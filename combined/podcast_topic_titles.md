Original Idea: I hope I'm not straying too far from the topic, but I think that learning how to argue and discuss things with people in order to express your needs and emotions is a form of self-care. What has improved your arguments and discussions with others? How have you learned to express how you feel to others without making them feel attacked and while still maintaining your personal space?

## Self Care
Original Idea: This has been my main struggle right now. I know a lot of tips when it comes to self care and taking care of mental health but lately it's been seeming like nothing will work or get better. But the thing is I know I'm not giving it a good effort and enough time for things to improve. I've just finished college and moved back home which is soooo frustrating because while I care about my family, I valued the space and autonomy I had living away from home. My life was full, I had school, a job, I would go out and now my life feels dull and hopeless. Yes, I would have tough times in college (some of the hardest) but I bounced back.

Now, nothing is going my way. I have a part time job but my hours are being cut which cuts into my money and also has me at home a lot more which is frustrating (see above) and gives me a lot of time to focus on everything that is wrong. I'm unsure about my career even though a few weeks ago I got excited about a path. I find myself yearning for my old life that I had in college and now I feel so angry at everyone which makes me feel worse.

I'm trying to do the things : work out, journal, reading, affirmations, investing in myself, having a life outside of romance and being healthy in my dating life, reducing screen time, working on rumination, accepting things that I can't control and having faith that things will get better; I'm usually a painful optimist but now I've been feeling low for months and I don't know what to do. When the good habits don't "immediately" improve my life, I feel like giving up and fall back into negative thoughts and habits and I have a pity party and my emotions spiral out of control.

I wish I could just get away for a bit and reconnect with myself but that doesn't seem possible. Has anyone felt like this? How can I be patient with myself? How can I stick to the good even when it feels unlikely?

TLDR: Post-college life feels empty after losing independence and routine. Frustrated that healthy habits aren’t giving quick results. I want to know how to stay patient and consistent when life feels hopeless.

Edit: Took out some extra details.

## Self Care
Original Idea: I feel like my self-care has just been lacking so much because I'm in school and still working at a restaurant 4-5 nights a week. My shifts are usually 4-11 or 3-10pm. I usually don't home until 1030-1130pm, and as a morning person it's a little rough. I am very thankful for my job, but I want to begin truly prioritizing taking care of myself and building better habits to wind down.

For anyone that works/has worked a shift like this, how did you wind down or relax/take care of yourself before bed? I try to get to sleep before 1230-1am, and it just feels terribly late. Most times I also can't eat until I get home, so trying to find lighter options for that that are still filling as well.

I've been trying to read/journal/etc. but it's so hard to build habits as someone with ADHD who hates making changes to their routine even if they know it's beneficial! TIA for all advice :)

## Self Care
Original Idea: To make a long story short, over the last month I have been playing “what is wrong with me” through hospital time and doctor appointments and many…many calls to specialists. During this time I have had little to no energy to do basic tasks like brush my teeth or even comb my hair somewhat. Just 100% neglecting myself outside of my great partner helping me rinse off/shower the basics. During this time too I have had to stick to a diet that is very different compared to my usual resulting in very rapid weight gain and what seems to be a chronic issue of the GI meaning an insane amount of bloating! I have stretch marks that came out of nowhere seemingly from so much bloat that now in my early 20’s my stomach is literally covered in them.

I have college coming up so very soon and I want to feel and honestly try to look my best. Is there any tips or advice you have to “glow up” in the span of a little over a week? I just feel like a lost cause because my teeth went from somewhat finally white to not…hair is not “hairing”…and my acne had decided to come back due to all the stress I am under! Anything that makes you feel hot or 100%, please share the everything routine!!

Original Idea: Hey everyone,

So, a little backstory: my girlfriend is super passionate about her haircare routine and a while back she told me how cool it would be to have a single app to track everything—her products, her wash days, her progress, all of it.

I'm a developer, so I thought, "Challenge accepted!"

After a lot of work, I'm excited to finally share **Hairelya** with you all. It's a free app I built for iOS, made for anyone who loves taking care of their hair. The main goal is to help you keep everything organized. You can create your own routine, keep a library of all your products, and track your hair's progress with a photo timeline.

A super important thing for me was to make sure that all the information in Hairelya is based on accredited scientific sources, university studies, and international scientific journals.

I have a bunch of useful new features planned that will be coming soon! For now, the app is only available on iOS, but I'm already working to bring it to Android in the future.

I'm really curious, how do you all keep track of your haircare journey right now? Do you use a notebook, a spreadsheet, or another app to log your routines, products, and progress pics?

I'm open to any feedback to help me improve the app and make it more complete, so I'd love to hear your thoughts. And if you end up trying it and find it helpful, leaving a positive 5-star review on the App Store would mean the world to me and really help the project grow.

I'm here to answer any questions you have!

Original Idea: Walking literally lowers stress hormones. It's not just a walk, it's a nervous system reset.

You don't have to 'figure it all out.' Just move.

A short walk lowers cortisol, and clarity follows.

The fastest way to calm your brain?

A 15 minute walk. This is the way.

## Self Care
Original Idea: I hope it’s okay to share something vulnerable – lately, I’ve been feeling pretty lonely. There are days when it feels like I just drift through life, going through routines, surrounded by people, but not really connecting. It’s hard to admit, and maybe it sounds cliché, but sometimes I really wish I had someone to talk to, someone who genuinely wants to get to know me and have fun together.

I’m not looking for a relationship right off the bat or anything forced. I just miss having good conversations, late-night chats, silly banter, and sharing small moments with someone. Whether it’s texting, hanging out, or just sharing things about our day, it would mean a lot to just have someone who cares.

I guess what I’m saying is: I’d love to meet a girl who feels the same way, who wants a genuine friendship and connection, and maybe more if things click. I’m open-minded, enjoy learning about new things, and appreciate all kinds of humor. I’m happiest just being myself, and I hope to find someone who feels comfortable doing that too.

If you’ve ever felt this kind of loneliness, or just want to talk, send me a message or reply here. Let’s share stories, memes, dreams, whatever! Life’s too short to go through it alone – maybe we can help each other feel a little less lonely.

Thanks for reading, and sending good vibes to anyone else feeling the same way.

## Self Care
Original Idea: When it comes to Japanese massage oils, the choices can be surprisingly diverse. They can also be a little intimidating for first-time buyers. Unlike heavy Western massage oils, Japanese blends tend to be lighter, faster-absorbing, and designed to complement massage styles like Shiatsu or Anma. The base oil matters a lot. Camellia (tsubaki) oil is a favorite for dry or mature skin. It’s rich, silky, and high in oleic acid. Rice bran oil is lighter, non-greasy, and packed with vitamin E, making it great for everyday use. Sesame oil, on the other hand, provides a little more grip, perfect for deep-tissue techniques.

Fragrance is another big decision. Many traditional blends are infused with calming scents like yuzu, hinoki, or green tea. They smell amazing, but if you have sensitive skin or simply prefer neutral scents, go for unscented cold-pressed options. Packaging might seem minor, but a pump bottle is a game-changer for home massage, no slippery hands fumbling with caps.

Price can vary widely. Spa-grade oils will be more expensive, but buying in bulk often cuts the cost significantly. I’ve found that high-quality Japanese massage oils can be sourced affordably through suppliers on Alibaba, which is especially useful if you’re stocking up or running a wellness business.

Ultimately, the “best” oil is one that matches your massage style, your skin’s needs, and your sensory preferences. Whether you go for luxurious camellia or versatile rice bran, choosing the right oil will make every massage session smoother, more enjoyable, and more effective.

## Self Care
Original Idea: Lately, I’ve been working on giving myself permission to set boundaries - without feeling like I have to justify them.

For years, my brain would tell me things like:

“You’re being selfish.”  
“They’ll be upset if you say no.”  
“You need a good reason to turn something down.”

But here’s what I’ve learned (thanks to a book called ***7 Lies Your Brain Tells You: And How to Outsmart Every One of Them***): those thoughts aren’t truths. They’re old mental scripts designed to keep me safe by keeping me agreeable.

Self-care isn’t just bubble baths and days off. Sometimes, it’s quietly saying:

“No, that doesn’t work for me.”  
… and leaving it at that.

You don’t need to write a defense essay for every choice you make.  
You don’t need permission to rest, protect your time, or prioritize your mental health.

If this is something you struggle with, maybe try this: next time you want to say no, do it simply - no overexplaining. See how freeing it feels.

## Self Care
Original Idea: For the longest time, I thought self-care meant dedicating big chunks of time - spa days, long workouts, full skincare routines. The problem was... life kept getting in the way, so I'd go weeks without doing anything and end up burnt out again.


Then I tried something different: instead of saving it all for "when I have time", I commited to one small, non-negotiable self care habit every day. For me, it's 5 minutes of intentional breathing + stretching right after I wake up.

It sounds ridiculously simple, but here's what changed:

- My mood lifted almost immediately in the mornings
- I started making better food and work choices without forcing it
- I didn't crash as hard in the afternoons
- I actually look forward to it - it's sustainable

If you're stuck in that all or nothng cycle with self care, try picking something tiny but consistent. You'd be suprised how quickly it compounds.

What's the smallest self-care habit you've found that actually moves the needle for you?

## Self Care
Original Idea: If there's anyone in your lives that use what you say against you, family members, 'friends', colleagues, what have you. Be super vague in what you tell them.

I have a colleague that loves to draw out info from people to use against them. But her tone is curious so I didn't notice at first. I learned about it and how being extremely vague in these circumstances may help and so I tried it at work. She asked about this project and I told her "it's fine" she asked about my partner "they're fine", she asked about this colleague that left "I don't know, hey?" And just kept giving her that. She lost interest pretty quickly and walked away. I haven't seen her since to see if she'll try again. But if she does, I'll do the same thing. It feels like such a release! Don't have to be anxious about her loser behaviour anymore. The power is back in my hands!

I hope this helps you!

Original Idea: I grew up with A LOT OF body shame. Family thought I was too short and chubby. Classmates said I was too tanned. Friends roasted my “terrible” fashion sense.

So yeah… looking in the mirror every morning was not exactly a cute “GRWM influencer” moment for me.

One day, a church aunty I’m really close to shared a little trick that completely changed my mornings. She had a small sign taped to the bottom corner of her bathroom mirror that read:

**“You are lovable and capable.”**

My bathroom setup didn’t work for a sign like that, but I started saying it to myself out loud every morning. And it worked. It brought me confidence, comfort, and a softer way to start my day.

I hope this little story brightens yours. Please remember: every girl is born equally beautiful. Period.

Body shame is one of the biggest lies that satan told us. Don’t listen to it.

Original Idea: Repeat these to yourself today:

My body is my home, and I treat it with care.

I thank my body for all it does for me every day.

I listen when my body asks for rest, nourishment, or movement.

I release shame and invite gratitude for my body’s changes.

I love my body in every stage, in every shape.

I nourish my body because I deserve to feel good.

My health is a gift, and I cherish it.

My body is my first and last home, and I promise to keep it safe.

I thank my body for the quiet miracles it performs every day without me asking.

I trust my body to tell me what it needs, and I choose to listen.

I release every cruel thing I’ve ever said about my body. it no longer belongs to me.

I am allowed to love my body while still letting it change.

I feed my body with kindness. in food, in words, in thoughts.

My body is worthy of soft clothes, warm baths, deep breaths, and unhurried mornings.

I honour my body’s cycles, energy, and limits.

My health is a gift I nurture, not a standard I punish myself with.

Every day, my body carries me closer to the life I’m creating.

Original Idea: I’ve been doing this for a couple months now as part of my self care routine and I swear it’s one of the easiest hacks to stop mindless night scrolling and actually sleep.

Basically, I turned my phone screen red in the evenings. Not just “Night Shift” or “Night Light”, I mean full-on red screen, no blue light at all. It makes your screen look like a horror movie but in the best way.

Why it works:
- Blue light destroys melatonin and tells your brain it’s still daytime
- Red light doesn’t mess with your sleep hormones
- Everything looks so ugly and boring that you literally don’t want to scroll TikTok or check Instagram
- It tricks your brain into “ok, we’re winding down now” mode

How to do it (iPhone):
- Go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Color Filters
- Turn on Color Filters, pick Color Tint
- Set Intensity to max, Hue all the way to red
- Then go to Accessibility Shortcut and set it to Color Filters
- Now just triple-click your side/home button to toggle it on/off

You can even set an automation from the automations app so it runs automatically when the sun sets. Plus off when the sun rises.

Anyway, try it. Free, easy, and actually helps. Let me know if it works for you too.

## Self Care
Original Idea: I always *wanted* to journal - because I knew it could help. But every time I tried to start, I’d fall off after a few days.

Sometimes I ran out of things to say. Sometimes I just kept spiraling in the same anxious thoughts. Other times, life got loud, and journaling felt like another chore on my already full plate. It started feeling more like pressure than peace. And isn’t self-care supposed to be the opposite of that?

After trying (and quitting) for years, I finally found an approach that made journaling feel gentle, supportive, and actually healing. Here’s how it changed:

1. I made space for reflection - even when life was chaotic.

I used to think journaling had to be this perfect morning routine thing - with silence and 30 minutes of undisturbed time. Now I just do it whenever I need a reset. On the train, during lunch, or right before sleep. As long as I have my phone, I can reflect, breathe, and come back to myself - even if it’s just for a few mindful minutes.

2. I stopped pressuring myself to “figure it all out.”

Blank pages stressed me out. Prompts felt cheesy. But this approach guided me with questions that felt thoughtful and real, like:

>“What fear or discomfort are you avoiding today?”  
“How is your inner critic shaping the story you’re telling yourself right now?”

It didn’t feel like I was performing or trying to “do it right.” It just helped me slow down and be honest with no pressure to fix, just notice.

3. I found support without the noise.

I’ve always felt kind of alone in this self-care stuff (especially journaling). But now, I get to see others’ public reflections too and even share pieces of mine if I want. AI helps turn my private writing into digestible insights I’m actually proud to share.

No toxic positivity. No comparison. Just real people supporting each other through the messiness and complexity of taking care of ourselves.

In just a month, I’ve noticed emotional patterns I didn’t realize were draining me, caught negative loops before they spiraled, and built a routine that actually feels nurturing rather than forced.

If any of this speaks to you, check out the tool I’ve been using. It’s called August: Emotional Intelligence. It’s private, calming, and finally made journaling feel like something I get to do, not something I have to.

Original Idea: Like it's another job. It is another job to take care of myself: not skipping meals, sleeping enough, drinking water, having a mostly clean space. But when I think of that it already feels like too much. Then I think of meditation, journaling, yoga, working out, socializing, hobbies, gratitude practices, self compassion, eating healthy... Then everything becomes a big blob and I find myself unable to move. Today I chose not to think after realizing I was paralyzed mentally. It's my day off and even though I was supposed to work a bit from home before my holidays starting Friday, I choose to go out, go get a coffee, buy some pretty nails polishes and beads and meet my sister for a coffee date and a walk. It felt really nice but coming home it's the same. Everything feels too daunting. I dream about being able to do like these people who journal and color little boxes in bullet journals about how they took care of themselves day by day. If you ever felt this way how did you overcome it ? I know I should probably accept I have days when I won't be able to do everything. Or I would spend my whole day taking care of myself. But I still feel frustrated I am not able to tick all those boxes. I don’t know if it makes sense.

Original Idea: So im kind of trying it out, but im not sure how good it is. You can add custom tasks each day and the basic ones that are already there are like "get out of bed, wash your face, brush your teeth" etc.

I've added my own one like have a weightlifting and such.

Does anyone else use it? I'm not sure how much it is really doing for me and I was wondering if there was other alternatives out there. I first for the idea when I realised duolingo has me on a hook where I want to keep my streak going then I figured finch might do the same thing for keeping my self care in check.

Original Idea: I'm a night shift nurse and I find that on my days off I basically just bed rot and doom scroll TikTok. I'm struggling with depression lately. I am in therapy and just got a prescription for some new meds. But I feel like I need to find a purpose for my off days, give myself some kind of routine that isn't just laying in bed all day and then beating myself up later for not being productive. 

I dont have good habits on my work nights either..I dont eat or hydrate enough, I dont get to take breaks (literally no one to relieve me). 

I plan on working on habits all around but I feel like starting with my off day routines would be the best. 

Are there any other night shifters here that could share some easy, low effort self care tasks or routines?

When I’m doing well mentally, a lot of the self care stuff slips through the cracks. I know it’s It’s a really weird habit I picked up since most people are the reverse.

Life gets heavy, and I push through on autopilot, forgetting to slow down and do things that make me feel human again. I want to get better at giving myself grace, setting boundaries, and finding little ways to heal instead of just surviving.

## Self Care
Original Idea: Dear everyone, I saw a very popular discussion in selfcare recently on mental health apps, and I wanted to jump in and share some insight how to make sure the health apps you select are ***SAFE***.

I’ve worked with apps for the past decade. Mostly in areas that handle very sensitive data (mental health, healthcare, underage users, and finance).

The amount of shady practices I saw in the industry even 5 years ago is surreal, and I am really concerned about the rise of health and mental health app *coded by AI.* I wanted to share some (*hopefully helpful!)* guidance on what unsafe and safe health apps look like, and common practices that can expose your data.

I hope you find it helpful!

❌ **Not safe**

1. **Apps uncontrollably using third-party 'SDKs'.** 'SDKs' are tiny pieces of code from other companies in the app you download. Apps integrate them to do things like send push notifications, collect analytics, show ads or measure ads. These SDKs (read other companies) often collect data automatically (e.g. like which screens you visit) unless a developer disables it explicitly. Some don't even allow developers turn off auto-collection, which means your sensitive data (e.g. symptoms) may be sent elsewhere alongside your device ID, email, etc..
   1. **Recommendation:** Check the app’s Privacy Policy to see which SDKs are used and what data they collect. You also have the right to request this info from the developer.
2. **Apps with ads**. To show ads in the app, developers use third-party SDKs too, but it actually gets worse: other companies (advertisers) need to know who you are to show a “relevant” ad. For this, the app (publisher) must share your data with them.
   1. **Recommendation:** Avoid health-related apps that show ads altogether.
3. **Apps sending sensitive data off your device**. Data can be stored *ON YOUR DEVICE* or sent to *SERVERS*. Smaller developers, especially folks without experience handling sensitive data, often store it in ways that aren’t secure. For example, developers can see your entries with their own eyes *or* in the same database they have BOTH your personal info (e.g. email, name, and sensitive info (symptoms)). If there's a breach (e.g. Tea app), people outside will see it.
   1. **Recommendation**: If you can, choose apps that say they store sensitive data on your device (only you can see it), and not servers (others may see it). If data is stored on servers, the Privacy Policy should clearly explain the security measures, and ideally, the app should be security-certified.
4. **Apps with no data controls**. Apps collect *a lot* of data about you. A LOT. No, **A LOT**!!! But very few allow you to actually manage your data (e.g. delete it quickly).
   1. **Recommendation**: If you can, go for apps in which you can delete your data from the app's settings.
5. **“Built with AI in two weeks”**. This one’s self-explanatory :D
   1. **Recommendation**: Stick with apps that are regularly updated, clearly explain their data practices, and have detailed, non-templated Privacy Policies. Avoid any app that looks dodgy or vague about privacy.

✅ **Safest apps**

* Don’t use third-party SDKs, or if they have to, they give limited access to your data (you can see in their Privacy Policy)
* Have no ads *(cannot emphasise this one enough!)*
* Store sensitive data on your device
* Offer clear data controls in the settings
* Have a strong, detailed, and specific Privacy Policy

**Ideally:**

* Let you lock your account with Face ID / PIN / Touch ID *without* an upsell
* Transparent about their security practices and certifications

I hope it's valuable! Please stay safe and read Privacy Policies. ✌️

Original Idea: Lately, I’ve been feeling overwhelmed. It seems like everyone around me is carrying so much pain, stress, and emotional baggage, and I often find myself in the role of the listener. While I want to be there for the people I care about, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to carry the weight of so many other people’s traumas.

I find myself emotionally drained after conversations, even if I didn’t share anything personal myself. I’ve begun to wonder: how do I stop internalizing other people’s traumas? How can I continue being a supportive presence without losing my own sense of emotional balance? Is there a way to care without carrying everything?

Original Idea: I used to think self care was what you did on weekends. But after going through emotional burnout earlier this year, I realized it has to be part of everyday life, especially when you feel too tired to care for yourself.

Now, self care means checking in with my emotions before I check emails. It means resting *before* I’m on empty. It means reminding myself I deserve peace, not just productivity.

Have you ever had to rebuild your self care from the ground up?  
What did that look like for you?

Original Idea: hey y’all,  
anyone else struggle with taking rejection super personally? like, it hits way deeper than it probably should...

Whether it’s getting a C on an exam, critical feedback from a professor, friends turning down party invitations, or even just being ignored after sending a cold email at work...it all makes me spiral into this “im not good enough” mindset.

I grew up as the classic A+ student and chronic people-pleaser, so the idea that effort doesn’t always equal results (or approval) is really hard for me to process. And now that I’m older, I’m realizing rejection is just a part of adult life, at school, at work, in relationships... everywhere.

If you’ve been through this, how did you learn to cope or take things less personally? Would appreciate any advice or mindset shifts that helped you!!

## Self Care
Original Idea: Many dismiss impulse shopping for emotional comfort as superficial, yet it often serves as a genuine coping mechanism. When we feel overwhelmed or powerless, making a purchase can restore a sense of agency and provide temporary relief.

**The real purchase:** Often we're not acquiring an object—we're trying to buy an emotional state or experience.

**The deeper issue:** The item itself isn't problematic. Problems arise when shopping becomes our automatic response to emotional discomfort. This pattern can mask our authentic needs—perhaps we're actually craving rest, meaningful connection, or validation.

**Self-examination:** After an impulse purchase, notice whether you feel genuinely satisfied or if regret follows quickly.

**A mindful approach:** Before making an unplanned purchase, pause and ask: "Am I buying this because I truly want it, or am I trying to fill another need?" This isn't about judgment—it's about awareness. Sometimes the answer will be yes, you do want the item. Other times you might realize you simply need a break or some quiet time.

Wanting beautiful things is perfectly natural. However, the emotional fulfillment we seek through purchases might be available through simpler means that don't require spending money.

Original Idea: forgiving yourself isn’t about forgetting what happened. it’s about finally deciding to stop living there.

if you need a place to start, try this:

stop blaming yourself for not knowing. you weren’t supposed to know what you didn’t know. 

say thank you to your past self. you may have made mistakes, but you also kept you alive long enough to get here.

decide the lesson is enough. you don’t have to keep punishing yourself once you’ve learned from it.

interrupt the spiral. when you catch yourself shaming old you, say out loud: “no. i was doing my best. we don’t live there anymore.”

build new proof. every time you choose better now, you’re rewriting your story.

forgiveness isn’t instant. it’s a decision you keep making until it feels natural.

and one day, you’ll look back and realize: the you you used to hate is the reason you became the version of you you’re proud of now.

Original Idea: A while ago, I got my brows shaped at a salon, which definitely made them look cleaner—but also a bit thin, which got me thinking about trying a brow lift. I wasn’t really sure if it’d suit me, or if it would look weird on a guy, so I hesitated for a bit.

Eventually I just gave it a try using the lash lift kit my girlfriend had.
She’d been using it for her own lashes, and since it came with 10 uses, there was still some left over. I had helped her apply it once before, so I figured I’d just use the same method on my brows and see what happens.

I followed the basic steps, took my time with it, and honestly didn’t expect much—but it actually came out looking a bit more lifted and tidy. Nothing dramatic, just more put-together.

What caught me off guard was that people noticed. A coworker said I looked more refreshed, my girlfriend asked if I’d done something to my face, and even a friend brought it up without knowing exactly what changed.

It’s a small difference, but I like how it turned out.
If any guys here are on the fence about trying it, I’d say it’s not a bad move—especially if you already have a kit lying around

Original Idea: I have been on a mental healing and self care journey for a while now, but it's all happening at the same time that I'm on a journey in learning how to be a good leader at work. These things seem complimentary, but the striving, overachiever, perfectionist in me is finding it hard to maintain boundaries and my self care is suffering. 
I have read countless books and feel like I have all of the fundamentals down but I can't seem to put any of it into practice. I'm repeating the same mistakes every day and end each day feeling disappointed, guilty, frustrated. I'm exhausted and I am yearning for something in me to shift where I really truly believe that I am enough. It's like I'm stuck on this hamster wheel of trying to excel so that I can prove to myself I'm worthy. I don't want to do it anymore but I don't know how to stop while I'm also investing in my leadership skills. 
Has anyone dealt with this? Any good resources for me to learn how to tackle both at the same time?

What recommendations do you have / what has worked for you to reset your life after a relationship  which was draining, hurt your self-esteem or made you question who you are?  

I’ve been thinking about solo travel (max 2 weeks, still have to pay the bills), wellness retreats, leadership training programs, new hobbies in the arts / photography, painting, music, and active / endurance training like half-marathons or triathlons.  

I already have some great friends and hobbies like foreign language study, cooking, fitness classes, etc. but there is something missing.

Original Idea: I'm just looking for a bit of advice. I know a doctor is the first place someone should go for advice when it comes to medical concerns but I have actually ran that route and am now just looking for opinions and possibly personal experiences. I suffer from pretty bad anxiety and depression and have for years. I started taking antidepressants a couple years ago and they definitely helped but didn't completely eliminate the problem. I was sedentary for years working a sedentary job and only going hiking occasionally throughout the year but spending most of my time smoking pot and drinking to relax. About a month ago I decided to make some big changes and cut back on the smoking and quit drinking and start eating clean. A week ago I started running and doing push ups three times a week. After finishing my third day of the week I noticed my anxiety had become pretty bad again. I also am having heart palpitations (heavy beat no skip) the day after exercise and difficulty sleeping. I also feel like I'm short of breath and agitated. I went last year to a cardiologist and had an ultrasound of my heart as well as multiple ecg and everything was fine. My O2 level is between 96 and 99 with a blood pressure of between 135/75 and 145/85. Though this is hypertension it's lower than my bp was a month ago, usually 150/85 to 170/90. I just feel crappy and it's eating into my self esteem and once again making me want to quit. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Thanks.

Original Idea: How do you get back to any self care if ever? I want sone time to myself. I love being mom to my 4mo but my nails look like garbage, I haven't taken care of my skin, no hobbies. My life feels flipped upside down. Any advice? Without bringing hubby into it? I feel so ugly and boring!

## Self Care
Original Idea: After working since March 2020, I will be going in five days a week into the office starting fall of 2025
I suffer from low energy as well as pre-diabetes. My commute is going to be at least 40 minutes each way. 
I also have a three year-old who I like to do meal prep fresh every morning 
I’m very bad at self-care and seeing that at least a couple of hours a day are going to be reduced for me because I’m gonna be commuting and spending time in the big office. I’m very concerned that whatever a little self-care or personal hygiene I can take care of right now I will not have any time for it. 
Any recommendations for easing the transition back to work and also to make myself more comfortable sitting in an office for eight hours I usually have mid back pain and fatigue setting in pretty early. Just just commuting to work sometimes makes me tired. What are your best self-care tips, especially for lasting a day in the office as well as having some energy once you’re back home

Original Idea: I dont argue anymore.
I just disappear.

No big speech, no dramatic send off. Just me slipping out of rooms, conversations, and lives the second it stops feeling good.

Silence is power. I don’t need closure when I can just… leave.

## Self Care
Original Idea: I knowww I knoww I knoww, this probably sounds super obvious but I used to wear old t-shirts and loose pants at home since they were comfortable, but I didn’t feel cute in them so when i would freshen up in the bathroom I didnt have much motivation to look my best as it felt like it didn’t matter since I wasn’t going out.

But I now put on a cute top and jeans or even comfy pants that still looks like it can go well with a nice fit (basically any pants i didnt sleep in lol) before starting my day. I didn’t expect anything, but I felt more awake and actually like pushing myself to maximize my looks if you know what I mean. I brushed my hair, did my skincare, and kept things tidy and aesthetic. It just felt easier to take care of myself cuz i guess i was more motived.

But yeah pretty much whenever I wear clothes that I feel good in, whether i realize it or not i take better care of myself. I want to eat better, move around more. It just improves my self esteem.

I’m not saying outfits fix everything. But how you dress affects how you carry yourself. 

If you’ve been feeling low or unmotivated, try changing what you wear. Not to impress anyone but just for yourself! It might help more than you expect in your selfcare journey.

## Self Care
Original Idea: I'm in need of some pretty specific advice and I'm hoping y'all can point me in the right direction here - a lot of the nail subreddits have No Medical Advice rules and I'm not sure if this counts, so I thought I'd start here first. 

So, hi, I have an excoriation disorder that gets worse when I'm stressed out and I unfortunately have a stressful job that I'm stuck with for the foreseeable future. If my nails have any kind of edge at all, I will be unconsciously using that edge to pry up and destroy various bits of my dermis. Now I'm in therapy and I'm working on this, but beating the excoriation issue is my proverbial white whale so I need more than just willpower to overcome it. That's where this "prophylactic manicure" business comes in. 

For a while I decided to try to file my nails clear down to the quick, and rapidly discovered its actually physically impossible for me to get my nails short and blunt enough - even when my nails were the shortest I could get them, it'd only last a day before the regrowth provided enough of a sharp edge for me to do damage. I have executive functioning issues that means I cannot commit to daily refiling, so that was a bust. The only solution that's ever worked was when I got a gel manicure with acrylic tips for my wedding - the edges on the false nails were so blunt and round, the most damage I could do was some bruising. It was so nice to watch all those angry patches heal up! Sadly, manicures are expensive and again there's a "regular time commitment" issue that doesn't square very well with my executive functioning. 

My question is this: 

Is there a way I can file my nails that would successfully round and blunt the edges of my natural nails? Is there some kind of product I could buy and apply myself that would mimic the blunting effect of a gel-with-tips manicure? Am I simply going to have to get over myself and find the time to learn how to do my own extensions every weekend? 

I am fully up a creek, I'm completely out of ideas, and my skin is so mad at me - any advice you can offer will be so appreciated. Thanks in advance!

## Self Care
Original Idea: ik, ik, there are *so* many posts and videos out there saying “exercise helps with anxiety,” dopamine this, endorphins that. And sure, it makes sense. But honestly I never had the time or motivation to go to the gym consistently. I always felt like I should be studying a bit harder, nailing that A+, impressing another professor.

Plus… lifting weights or running around a track? honestly, I find that super boring. No offense if you enjoy it. it’s just not my thing.

Then earlier this year, I randomly signed up for a cardio dance class at a nearby gym. And GIRL. It changed everything.

Every coach I’ve met there is so chill, energetic, charismatic, and just fun, even when the moves are kinda cringe. Most of us in the class can’t keep up half the time (we’re not dancers!), but the coaches still hype us up like we’re killing it:  
"Y’all look SO cute!"  
"OK I SEE YOU!!"

That kind of energy was exactly what i needed.

For the first time, when I saw myself doing those moves in the mirror, I didn’t feel awkward or try to hide. I just smiled and thought, “Hey, I think I actually like how I look.”

Growing up with a lot of body shame (thanks to cultural pressure), I never thought I’d feel that way. But now I know, that shame was a lie. Every girl is born beautiful. Period.

In addition, cardio dance is *so* fast that I literally don’t have time to think about my homework, my presentation, my upcoming exam, or the anxiety that comes with all of that. If I zone out, I’ll miss the next step. So it forces me to live in the moment. That, in itself, is therapy.

If you're struggling with anxiety or body image, give cardio dance a try. It gave me confidence, community, and the kind of joy I didn't know I was missing.

10/10 would recommend. Lets danceeeee💃

## Self Care
Original Idea: I have been going through some personal issues for a while. I have been asking myself to still go exercising every other day because I want those good hormones. 

Usually I feel sad and insecure while I was commuting. When the negative emotions hit me , I typically text friends and rant. I rarely think about just feeling it. I am grateful that there is a supportive network around me. 

But today during my work out, I was deliberately called on all the negative emotions and invited them to hit me while I was at the peak of my cardio. I was trying to recall all the negative labels / imagine the worst cases while working hard! I wanted to know how it felt to be swallowed by negative emotion when my body was in a different state. 

But I felt nothing, then slightly empowered and seem to walk across a psychological barrier. I realise ‘oh, even the worst situation is just like this, I am confident that I can rebuild it as long as I am alive. It is tremendously liberating! I would not say I dissipate all the negative emotions. But I feel it is not as scary as I thought 


I think when I am weak, I should take defence , not to feel the emotion, distract myself but when I am strong , I think I can take on them. 

That is the lesson learnt

## Self Care
Original Idea: disclaimer: not an ad lol, just something that really helped me.

earlier this year, i was drowning in schoolwork and my anxiety got really bad. the major trigger being my messy sleep schedule. i’m the kinda person who starts spiraling if i keep staying up late. it makes everything feel hopeless.  
BUT i had so many deadlines and projects that i just kept pushing my bedtime later and later. the worst part? i’m naturally a morning person, so late-night studying was super inefficient and just made me feel worse.

i tried EVERYTHING to fix it: sleep hygiene stuff, alarms, routines... nothing stuck. until i found this app called routinery. it lets you break down your morning and evening routines into tiny, timed tasks. each task is super easy by itself, but doing them all gives you this sense of momentum. and if you’re like me (adhd brain), that countdown + reminder combo helps so much!!

plus, the alarm won’t shut off until you open the app and actually start your routine, which kinda ate. used it for 2 months straight and it totally fixed my sleep schedule. anxiety got better. i finally felt like i had my life together.

BUT sadly the app recently started crashing constantly and now i can’t use it anymore. chaos has returned 🫠

anyone know a similar app that works well for building habits or routines? preferably something ADHD-friendly. would really appreciate the recs!

Original Idea: Right now I’m struggling quite a bit with my anxiety and depression. One thing I’m consistently told is to show myself love and to practice self-care every day but at this point, I feel like I don’t really even know what it is.

I know it sounds dumb, but in my mind, I imagine self-care as eating an ice cream sandwich or sleeping in or laying in bed playing on my iPad all day, but I’m starting to wonder if that’s actually not self-care and is actually making things worse for me.

I guess another way to ask my question is where do you draw the line at overindulgence / unhelpful behavior? Where does discipline play a role in self care? 

Thanks in advance 💟

Original Idea: I’ve started to get back into baking and playing with recipes that I think have potential. My last attempt at zucchini bread was well received by the neighbors even though the loaves wouldn’t come out of the pan. 

Screw it. Grab a fork and a knife and butter!

It tasted awesome and I made it on a day where I started it not wanting to even open my eyes. 

Some mornings start with a deep breath and saying “yup. It’s Wednesday. Get your ass up and be a person.”  Then argue with the alarm for a while and just get up and move. 

Let today be a good day and tomorrow will shine as well. 💜

Original Idea: this started for me in a really dark place. i don’t know how i knew to do this or how/ why i was able to do this but i did. i was down to nothing and because of that i was able to completely rebuild myself as a new person. which weirdly looking back im kind of greatful for. 

i’ve said this before but it’s the truth, flipping my thoughts is what changed everything for me.

any time i had a thought that didn’t feel good, i’d switch it straight away. even if it wasn’t true yet. and it really wasn’t true for me. even if it felt fake. i just kept doing it. and over time, things started shifting, how i felt, what showed up, all of it.


i’m tired → i’m so full of enerfy

i’m cold → im so warm

i can’t be bothered → this will be easy i can’t wait till ive done it 

i’m so behind → im right where im meant to be

i’m dreading today → today is going to be a good day i’m so excited for today! 

this is hard → this is so easy i’m so good at this!

i don’t know what i’m doing → i can do this i know what im doing!

i messed everything up → it’s gonna be ok it’s always ok! i’m always ok!

i’m not good enough → i am more than good enough! i’ve got this!

i lost everything → it’s always ok in the end everything always works out in the end!

i’m scared to start again → im so excited for what’s to come! 

i have nothing → i have this, this and this

i feel alone → im so happy to have this time alone  with myself

i hate myself → i love myself so much 

i feel empty im so depressed → im so happy im so excited 

i don’t want to wake up → im so happy i love myself life 

i think looking back from what i remeber a lot of it was just stopping the thoughts and feelings straight away and thinking ‘im so happy! im so happy!’ as simple as that. 

i did this with every thought and feeling. it took work. years of undoing. you do this often enough the positive becomes natural and it’s now my default. 

then from this.. i only have positive thoughts and was able to now live in this state of self and energy and i can’t even list the magical things ive been able to experience, manifest, live etc etc 

i can’t say this enough where it is believable but i did not know happiness for being alive was real. but it is? it’s just the maddest thing. 

and that’s how i changed my mindset, my energy, and my whole life.

in the most simplest way i can explain right now. i’m recently learning so much about what i actually did. i had not heard of neauroplasticity untill recently which seems to be what i did. but i’m hoping to be able to share and explain better when i can. realising now that im able to understand what i did and share and help what i learnt from such bad times is really mind blowing for me.

thanks for reading! 🩷

## Self Care
Original Idea: It’s not selfish to choose what you surround yourself with.

Everything in your environment, people, places, habits, conversations, either feeds your energy or drains it. When something starts to feel heavy, when you leave an interaction feeling smaller instead of brighter, that’s not you being sensitive. That’s your body telling you the truth.

You’re allowed to listen. You’re allowed to step back. You’re allowed to protect your peace, even if it means disappointing others. Because peace isn’t a luxury; it’s the foundation that keeps you aligned.

The more you protect your energy, the clearer everything becomes. You stop fighting battles that were never yours. You stop chasing things that don’t feel good. And suddenly, there’s room for what does, people who actually pour into you, opportunities that feel light instead of forced, and a life that matches your frequency.

This isn’t selfish. This is sacred. Protecting your energy is how you make space for the version of you that thrives.

You are not here to live in survival mode. You are here to choose what grows you and let the rest go.

## Self Care
Original Idea: I had a draining and frankly unpleasant interaction with a colleague that has left me feeling like a) I have no energy, b) I’m useless at my job and my life and c) I want to point out to them how miserable they are. It went something like this: 

1) I mentioned I’ll be working over Christmas, as I’m not particularly festive and I like the extra money. They said they “also despise Christmas - it’s for people who are dull and have no life. And I also hate people who go on holiday.” That’s … uh … almost everyone then? Travel and hiking are literally my salvation. I also don’t despise Christmas … more that it’s draining for me because of past trauma and I’d rather work. It’s fine if other people like it. 

2) They spewed hatred at cyclists, based on a tiny few interactions with a tiny few, probably bad-mannered, cyclists, in a capital city where there are plenty of bad-mannered road users of all descriptions.

3) They said they’d rather have a pint with a very right-wing, highly unpleasant politician in my country than listen to a couple of popular, overplayed songs on the radio. No, you wouldn’t. That is just ridiculous. I laughed and said “you’re joking” - they fixed me with one of those looks that said “I’m deadly serious and I’d thank you not to question me.”

4) They openly criticised someone’s work to me, without at first realising that it was my work. I asked them who wrote the offending item and they suddenly couldn’t find it to check. What a cop-out - we both knew it was my work, and if it was a problem then why not helpfully suggest corrections instead of bitching about it? 

5) They rolled their eyes and made disparaging comments when I spoke with a different colleague about our hobby of running, saying the only thing they’d ever run for was a bus. I said no, the only thing you’ve ever run is a bar tab. It wasn’t their conversation to hate on - and it was already fairly clear they hate hobbies and people with hobbies. 

6) To hear them speak, you’d think they are the only one who ever works to a decent standard. They criticised the work of other people (besides mine) all day, saying at one point: “How do these people get jobs?” Only when I suggested talking to a manager about the standard of work did they actually bother to talk to a manager about the standard of work. 

7) They disclosed that they were in an abusive relationship and have PTSD. That may be true - it’s not for me to judge, and I’m sorry if it is true. However, their constant need to complain about others and dominate every conversation makes me wonder if they are being honest. I was also in an abusive relationship years ago and it’s not the first thing I tell people. I don’t like the uneasy feeling of “I don’t quite believe this person.”

I went home feeling drained, bad at my job, and guilty for having hobbies that distract me from my own mental health issues. This person clearly has a lot going on too, but they project it onto others. I don’t know how to ignore them and take care of myself. I feel like I don’t deserve to take care of myself.

## Self Care
Original Idea: Developing self-care as a coping mechanism can empower you to navigate relationships with narcissistic individuals. By focusing on your own well-being and personal growth, you create a space that encourages them to reflect on their behavior and recognize the discrepancy between their words and actions. This approach not only strengthens your resilience but also promotes healthier dynamics in your interactions.

## Self Care
Original Idea: A little while ago, I posted here asking whether I should try shaping my messy eyebrows myself, ask my girlfriend to help, or just go to a salon. (For context: I had previously helped her with a DIY lash lift—kind of messed it up—but it got me interested in all this self-care stuff.)

In the end, I went to a salon and got my brows cleaned up professionally. I’m actually happy I did—it looks way neater and way less frustrating than trying it solo.

That said, I’m planning to manage the upkeep myself from now on, maybe with a little help from my girlfriend when needed.

But now here’s my next dilemma:
After the cleanup, my brows look kinda... thin? Not patchy, just softer than I expected. So I started looking into brow lifts (lamination) and I’m thinking of trying it DIY.

Question is—does brow lamination/lift look good on guys too? Has anyone here tried it, or seen it done well on men?

Would love to hear your thoughts before I go and perm my eyebrows 😅

## Self Care
Original Idea: I used to believe self care had to be a big, complicated routine, but I’ve learned it’s truly about the small things I do for myself every day. Whether it’s taking a few minutes to breathe deeply, enjoying a cup of tea without distractions, or just giving myself a break when I need it those tiny acts add up.
Self-care for me is learning to listen to what I need in each moment, not just following trends or routines I see online. Some days it’s a walk outside, other days it’s not forcing myself to be “productive” all the time.
How do you practice self-care in your everyday life? What’s a small habit that’s made a big difference for you? Would love to hear your ideas!

Original Idea: I’m not in the right headspace for that right now

That’s not something I want to continue talking about

I’m taking a step back, but all is well

I’m not available for that, but I hope it goes well for you

I care, but I can’t hold space for this at the moment

I need to stay in my own energy today

That doesn’t align with where I’m at

This isn’t something I can say yes to right now

I’m taking some quiet time nothing personal

I’m choosing peace over pressure

I don’t have the energy to engage with that, but I’m okay

I’m not ignoring you I’m just recharging

Let’s pick this up another time, if it still feels right

I love me too much to abandon myself for approval

If it drains me, it’s not mine

Saying no is how I say yes to the version of me I’m becoming

I protect my energy like it’s sacred. Because it is

I’m not rude, I’m just unavailable for anything that disrespects my growth

I don’t feel guilty for protecting the me I’ve worked so hard to become

I’m not cold. I’m healed, calm, and too in love with my life to let chaos in

I am the safe space I used to look for in other people

I love me. I look after me and I finally believe it

## Self Care
Original Idea: I'm at work and listening to two coworkers gossip and talk about men/relationships they've had, and I'm not really part of the conversation. I turned on HBO Max and I realized that the movie Wonka is especially soothing to me. Its like visual, cinematic fondue. It is such a "feel good" kind of movie.

For me especially it's about a boy who grew up chasing a fleeting dream his mother gave him. I wanted to see this movie from the moment the first trailer came out, I saw it with my ex-girlfriend and her two friends and for some reason that fact has not made me dislike it any less. It is such a cheery movie. The music numbers are giddy and the themes spectacular.

I can gush more, but I think its a movie that's simple, not triggering or cynical. And its one of very few films I am willing to rewatch over and over again.

## Self Care
Original Idea: after a week of running on empty, I wanted to share a gentle reminder that self-care can be simple, imperfect, and still matter more than we realize.
Today, I slowed down for five minutes to notice how my tea smelled, let myself take a long shower just because it felt good, and put my phone down to listen—really listen—to a song that makes me feel like myself. None of it was fancy. None of it fixed the harder things. But for a little while, those small intentional pauses helped me reconnect with my own kindness.
Self-care isn’t always bubble baths or grand gestures. Sometimes it’s just letting yourself rest without guilt, feeding yourself when you’re tired, or saying “no” when you’ve overloaded your day. It’s noticing you’re worth gentle moments just as much as anyone else.

## Self Care
Original Idea: For a long time, I thought self-care had to be something big,  like spa days or buying fancy things. But that felt overwhelming and hard to keep up. What really changed for me was starting tiny habits: drinking an extra glass of water, stepping outside for a few minutes, or writing one sentence in a journal each night.

These small acts helped me feel more connected to myself without pressure. It’s not about being perfect, but about showing up gently for myself every day.

What small self-care habits have helped you the most? How do you make time for yourself when life gets busy?

Original Idea: I've been divorced for around a year now.  I've been reconnecting with old friends especially my old female friends that I was always in the friend zone with and to be honest I don't want to be anywhere else with them.  It's nice to enjoy the presence of another person that I know doesn't have some long term schemes of control. Anyways it's comforting to me hanging with old friends again. Hopefully everyone that has lost contact with old friends will find a way to reconnect.  There's my positive wishes for the day.

Original Idea: Lately I’ve been trying to remind myself that it’s okay to not always feel strong. I put a lot of pressure on myself to be “the confident one,” especially when people expect it but the truth is, I get overwhelmed too.
Sometimes my anxiety makes the smallest tasks feel impossible. And being neurodivergent in a world that doesn’t always understand can be really isolating. I used to hide those parts of me, thinking they made me “less than.” But I’m slowly unlearning that.
Self-care for me lately has meant giving myself permission to just be messy, tired, emotional… human. If any of you are feeling the same, just know you're not alone. You don’t have to have it all figured out to deserve love and care.💙

Original Idea: hi, so yesterday I bought three items. I'm a 15 year old female. i feel bad for buying these, but I'll get into why:

the first is a blackhead removal mask. the second is a makeup storage container thing that I want to put all my bathroom products in, because my counter is cluttered. the last one was an anua face cleanser because I saw in the reviews this guy's face looked so clean after! 

my main thing for buying these is my face gets oily, especially when I sleep and stuff... i don't exactly have the best track record of taking care of myself. so with summer ending, I feel like i should get into a routine. i also am not diagnosed with depression, but I think I do have moderate depression... but that's a different issue.

anyways, on Amazon I have to be approved whenever I order things (with my money). it's not what I like, but it's what I've always done. so I buy these three things (there was a deal on one, so I felt inclined as well), and my mom calls me. she doesn't live with me and my dad and my sister anymore because she used to drink a lot and she still does. so she calls me, drunk, and I almost didn't pick up because she only ever calls me beyond 4 pm if she's drunk. every time she's called me I've never had a good memory out of it. 

so she starts interrogating me about why I'm buying these items. i tell her I feel like it's not a big deal. she's drunk, obviously starts going on about nonsense. she mentions things like "I don't think you should care about how you look," or when she's reading the items off she says, "and a pore cleanser, of course, because every teenager (I don't remember the rest)" stuff like that. 

now, I struggle a lot with feeling like I deserve things, whether I'm getting things or I'm buying something. my family isn't struggling for money or anything. but I have deep-rooted guilt inside me. I struggle with ignoring it and getting over it, and my sister always says I'm overreacting when it comes to these things. anyways, my mom always makes fun of me, usually when she's drunk. it's weird because when she's not drunk, I feel like I can like her, and she appreciates me. but when she's drunk she's not the same. idk if her true colors are showing or she's just drunk. 

so when she calls me and questions me about the items I'm purchasing (for not only to take care of myself, because my face is not in the best condition, but also to experiment as a whole, because she's never really been there for me when it comes to 'being a girl'. i kind of relied on the Internet, which really damaged my self-esteem), I feel really bad. it's horrible. and I feel angry that's she bothers to interact with me if she's just going to shame me. 

I'm 15, yes, but I feel like it's just health. I don't have good health and I'm trying to make an effort. but am I wrong for buying these things? is it because I'm too young? I'm not conventionally attractive but I do think I still have time to grow, but I want to be comfortable with myself asap, so why shouldn't I take these steps? it doesn't affect her at all. she acted as if it were her money and her life. she's not even in my life! am I wrong for buying these things?? 

I'm sorry if this isn't the place to ask. I'm not on reddit a lot. and just to clarify, I'm one of the few gen-z who aren't glued to TikTok. if that helps any. I don't use TikTok unless my sister send me TikToks. I'm smart for my age and only have a select group of friends that I can trust, and I'm not popular at school.

Original Idea: this may be a complete overreaction and a post like this may not belong here but hey🤷🏾‍♀️

so i'm (22f) fairly young, and a few days ago, i decided to make some changes to my lifestyle.

* ending the day with tea or tart cherry juice
* not using my bed for anything besides sleep
* asleep by 11:30 and awake by 7:30
* out of bed and dressed by 8:30
* winding down with calming, low-stakes bedtime stories instead of doomscrolling
* going outside every day
* cleaning more
* no caffeine after noon
* writing and reading in public
* a drink or two once every 2 weeks

since i'm graduating from college soon, i want to drop my old habits. i'm also tapping into my bookish side because i'm deadset on finishing the first draft of my y/a romance manuscript by the start of next year. 

i'm very proud of what i've accomplished so far, so i told my friends and family about it. for the most part, they're really happy for me! ... except one. she (20f) complained that i've started to "live like an old lady" and how i'm not cool anymore. and i mean... yeah, she can act a little funky, but i'm blindsided bc i wasn't expecting that reaction *at all*. i'm trying to not let it get to me, but i'm kind of at a loss here :/

## Self Care
Original Idea: I used to think self-care was mostly about slowing down, taking breaks, and doing nice things for myself - which it *absolutely* is. But recently, I discovered something that shifted how I treat myself on a deeper level:

I started noticing the lies my brain keeps repeating.

Stuff like:

“You have to earn rest.”  
“Everyone’s doing better than you.”  
“If you’re not productive, you’re falling behind.”

Turns out, these aren’t just fleeting thoughts - they’re internal scripts that shape how we feel and act every day. And they’re often completely false.

A book that helped me start gently pushing back on this is called **7 Lies Your Brain Tells You: And How to Outsmart Every One of Them** by Jordan Grant. It’s not preachy or overwhelming - it walks through seven common mental traps (like comparison, perfectionism, and burnout) and how to reframe them in a healthier way.

For me, learning to say, *“That’s not the truth - it’s just a thought,”* has been real self-care. Better sleep. Less guilt. More room to breathe.

If you’ve been feeling stuck in your head lately or constantly judging yourself, I really recommend giving it a read. Even just one chapter might help you be a little kinder to yourself this week.

## Self Care
Original Idea: I feel like it's really hard to be able to relax. When I have a day off or I am on holidays I build this pressure to "make it worth it". Meditation, yoga, working out, clean the apartment, do things I have put to the side, explore new hobbies, use the weekend to read or see something related to my work, see friends, see family, don't miss that event. It doesn't even feel relaxing anymore. I had health issues for two months that are hopefully starting to get better. I had six days off. I feel like it's the best time off I had in years. Because it wasn't planned, because I am sick the only goal was : eat, sleep, repeat. Sleep a lot to help my body heal. Honestly it was amazing. I ended up doing some decluttering but just because I felt like it and now my space feels even more welcoming. I felt suffocated by the clutter and now it feels like I just moved in. I just wanted to share as someone who tries to prioritize self care, it feels like wasting time to take a few days to just bedrot but it felt amazing. Maybe this will serve as a memo for me in the future.

Original Idea: I'm currently in a panic attack as I write this. And, it's hard to explain but, I know there's more I can do to help myself but my brain just.. won't let me. All it's letting me do is listen to music and play video games. But, it won't let me do other things that could help me like breathing, self care, grounding, etc. I feel paralyzed. Like on the one hand, I want to get rid of this panic attack so I can sleep. On the other hand I feel like I deserve this. Like if I calm down "too quick" I'm just faking it, and as if it's logical to be in a panic attack since people keep saying it's things I SHOULD be anxious about (the current US political climate). Like its insensitive to calm down. 

Idk if this is just some weird form of self harm or what but... Does anyone else get this? What should I do about it?

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say "PM me anytime" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


"PM me anytime" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say "PM me" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the "role model" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the "depression" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- "I'm here to help" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The "giving help" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. "achievement" or "advice" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that "internet culture" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The "what is depression" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.

Original Idea: Hi everyone, 20 here. I still live with my parents sadly. It’s been around a month I decided to straight up avoid and short the interactions with them because I can’t stand it anymore. They know my mental state but still use the excuse of “just joking” and “we do it to motivate you” or “we’re just worried” to criticize me and my actions daily. For instance, I was just told by my mother that my room is shit and that I am obliged to clean it. I told her clearly, like every time, that this isn’t something someone like me wants to hear, and ofc she blamed it on me saying I’m too sensitive and take everything personally. This happens with everything to the point I just stopped talking with them. I’ve been in this state for two years now and communication doesn’t work, I tried it so much. They “joke” that I’m lazy, pressure me constantly that I need to do something, act offended if I tell them I don’t feel like doing what they want me to do or simply don’t wanna talk. I’m the one called evil if I want to just be alone.

I don’t even have the energy, how am I supposed to solve this or move out? I am scared and I feel alone. Of course I have a therapist already and she knows about it, but she hasn’t given me any real solutions and in a way I understand why. How can I think about leaving if I can’t even do the simplest of tasks most of the time? I’m always nervous around them, and just about being home. I wish I had a supportive family.

Original Idea: Nothing has ever really gone right for me, and if it's going right, i always and i mean **ALWAYS** fuck it up some how. I'm 30 yrs old with nothing to my name, no education, no job, no money, not a lot of friends, constantly betrayed by people i called my friends, constantly hating myself because im ugly and incredibly unattractive, I'm unable to do anything on my own without someone holding my hand due to how badly i've fucked my life up and that im too scared to do anything on my own to no risk fucking it up further. 

My life by all means is a joke and everyday i'm more convinced to wanna take my life because nothing is getting better and i'm not smart enough to make it better. I'm scared to take my life, but at the same time i rather be dead than continue to be a disappointment to everyone i care about(if i still even care about anyone)

Idk what to do anymore, and no one in my life is actually trying to help me. They give me temp solutions and refuse to actually listen and realize how bad of a position I'm in. My own father rather gamble away his money than help me and my mom can die any day now from the fent AND crack she fucking takes. 

I really need some convincing to go jump in front of a train or something since people rather push me to suicide than actually help me.

Original Idea: For the last 1-2 years I’ve let depression and anxiety completely control my life and enough is enough. Something I’ve noticed is that I tend to shut down and be quiet towards everything going on in my life instead of opening up to people. I know my parents would be a great support system but I’m terrified at the thought of even mentioning what I’m going through even on a baseline level. The same goes with professional help which I’ve had before but I found I tend to struggle truly opening up about what truly is going on.

I want to end all this stagnation and not improving myself but I don’t know how, has anyone been in this situation before?

Original Idea: I actually have no real reason to feel this way .My life is actually really good and I have people that care about me ,but ever since I was little I've wanted to kill myself and I can't pinpoint exactly why.The only reason why I haven't done it is because I wouldn't really have anything to write in my suicide note other than then the fact that I'm overwhelmed. 
I don't have a hunger for life ,I never have .After every minor inconvenience, I start thinking about killing myself and I get a little excited because being dead might finally mean taking a breather (ironic, I know)
The real reason I'm writing this is to see if anyone can justify the way I'm feeling
Ps:I don't know if this is the right place to post this, but it's the first place I found

Original Idea: Tired of people just being players. I just have been depressed about this, because I just want someone to want me for me. I’m 24, male 5’11, and 125 pounds with a straight smile. I don’t feel good enough. It is probably 0.1% of swipe rights that are a match so when it doesn’t work out I get sad. It is a rare occurrence. Like why match to begin with if you weren’t interested?

Original Idea: Living with this has been difficult.  It's been 5 years since I realized I was the way I was.

I'm currently out of work on FMLA, going to psychiatry and changing meds every month or so to try and figure out what works. Getting broker and broker every week.  I cry whenever my wife and kids aren't looking.  Trying to hold everything together for them.  
I have no problem working, but my job is solo most of the time and my brain is telling me awful things about myself   How are you supposed to continue when your own mind is against you?

I'm always tired.  So tired.  No ambition to do fun things I've enjoyed.  

I'm ready to be better.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: Im (16F almost 17) I know I’m young and I’ve got my whole life ahead of me. I really do know that I just can’t help but feel so painfully depressed. I’ve been on antidepressants I’ve been in therapy I’ve done things like eating healthy working out going on walks I’ve tried everything and I always end up feeling awful again, I even got kicked out of college . It’s physically painful it’s not the kind of depression where I just sit in my bed and deal with it. I’ll be walking around my room breaking down because of how much I don’t wanna be alive anymore. I wouldn’t do that to my close ones not that I feel like I have anyone there for me, but I know people would care if I went, so I wouldn’t do that to them I feel so guilty. I feel like a burden to everyone and I know there’s people out there suffering with life way worse than I do. I feel so guilty for feeling so depressed when I know I’m lucky, I have my trauma though. I know if I fight through that maybe one day I will start to feel better. But generally don’t think I can get through it. Doctors won’t listen to me practically begging people for help and it feels like no one cares. I just don’t wanna be alive anymore and it’s getting worse and worse to the point I can’t even get out of bed, I had permanent scars on my body, lost my appetite feeling physically unwell feels like I’m rotting away. I don’t know what to do

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: I've (30m) been struggling with my ADHD and MDD for years, it's only recently that I've been medicated for it and have been able to make some progress and growth. It has affected my marriage and my ability to communicate clearly with my wife, as well as our banter and sex life. I get brain fog, I get distracted, I can't listen well, I can't focus, I can't comprehend, and according to her I cannot change. Which is true, despite my best efforts and despite the change I truly thought I saw in myself the past year, it doesn't matter.

She wants a divorce, and even though I have made true change to our issues after finally being able to overcome some of the hurdles of my ADHD and depression, it was too little too late. For her, it was what I should've done ages ago and it only took the threat of divorce a month ago for me to finally push myself to take more action and lead our family. Every other time we would talk about our issues, I would try to fix it for a few weeks, then get burnt out from the emotional and mental load of it all or she would reject my advances and I would let my rejection sensitivity slide me even deeper into depression. Every time I would push for couples therapy, she would push back and say we didn't need another person to help solve our issues. And instead of standing my ground, I took her at face value and let it be. I didn't have a spine.

I tried to make us work, I tried to overcome my disabilities, but I couldn't. And now my wife and son suffer for it. I lost myself trying to mold myself into the person she wanted me to be, which I know is unhealthy but I just wanted to be the ideal masculine guy she wanted to be with. In my entire life, I've never once been accepted for being who I am with the exception of my small group of friends. I thought for a long time that she did too, but she would later talk about how she looked down on me because of my hobbies and interests. I did everything to support her interests and her wants, but I tied my self worth to her and I'm only now learning how to recover from that.

I don't want to paint her in a negative light, she is incredibly loving and supportive and kind, but neither of us are perfect and we both have our own issues that we are seeking therapy for. I think I just pushed her to her limit because I couldn't figure my shit out and we couldn't find a common ground to feel fully vulnerable with each other.

Barely remember anything till 13–14, and even after that it’s the same, I can't remember names, faces, or the moments we might have spent together.
I barely remember anything else either, just random scene flashes, no faces. Honestly, I dun even wanna remember the past stuff

I don't particularly have negative thoughts, i don't really feel sad, i just feel hopeless and empty. It's devastating and i keep having suicidal thoughts, but I'm too tired to get out of bed and do it. I don't have anything that brings me joy, only sleep does. I'm on antidepressants, but they're not working (lexapro). School is starting soon and i don't think i will be able to study at all. I can't think, concentrate, talk, form thoughts, just emptiness. Please help, I don't want this to last forever, it's not worth it living like this

Original Idea: Yep. 3+ fucking months. Anyone with a regular brain wouldn't understand. I'm so burnt out on life, I dreaded the long pauses between clicks on a shitty clothing store website, constant popups/ads to show me their AMAZING new deals, having to pull out my debit card and typing in the number, etc. It was easier to just wear pants with holes in them that would eventually get so bad, I could get arrested for indecent exposure. All that to avoid the hellish experience of “online shopping.” How I get through any other facet of my life is nothing short of a fucking miracle. A victory like this, is just another day for anybody else. Just have to wait for them to come in the mail and the cycle can begin anew. 🤠

Original Idea: 16 years of battling depression, just turned 31 last week. 

Over half my life destroyed by this.

I would have been better of serving a 16 years prison sentence for a white collar crime, if that time was spend non-depressed. 

Tried 3 different types of antidepressants already. No remarkable improvement, yet many negative side effects, and feeling completely 'medicated' by them....

Also went to 2 different psychologists, which were absolutely NOT helpfull. They didn't offer any therapy, only listened to my depressed stories. In retrospect I feel scammed by those 2. How can you improve when all your doing is whine and complain for an hour every week to 'an expert' that just nods and hums as feedback?  

  
 jezus christ I'm really losing hope here.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: I have a friend who when I met was this energetic, laughing, independent person. We lost touch but have regrouped. However, she's different, and I don't know how to help anymore. Her dog recently died who was her world and I've been trying to be there as much as possible so she is not alone because she is afraid of being alone right now.

She also has an extremely toxic relationship with someone who cheats on her and is emotionally abusive but continues to go back to him even though she complains about him all the time. She has a back issue that makes it difficult for her to do normal tasks, she does PT for this. She won't go get a psychiatrist or new therapist. Her current doctor, who is not a psychiatrist, prescribes her 90 (xahnahx, spelled because I don't want this removed) a month, and she doesn't want to get a new doctor because she'll lose the prescription that is not helping her.

She struggles with eating and starves herself most days, you have to force her or remind her to eat. She is struggling now to function on her own. She is constantly upset. She breaks down to the point of screaming out of control. She stays in her house and seems to only be able to smoke weed all day. When I'm over she is always going down rabbit hole complaining about her lifestyle, her health, and her boyfriend.

Any advice I give her she doesn't take, in fact she usually does the opposite. When we hang out and I'm trying to get her outside, I can't get her dressed, I can't get her to eat, I can't get her out of her house. I have depression, so I can empathize. I am starting to feel helpless and I'm watching my friend fall apart. I'm getting frustrated and don't know what to do.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: Creative writing vent (??) I wrote about my experiences with mental illness, depression, and living through the reality of it. It's a simple and corny metaphor, but one that helps me, and I hope helps others, too.

The sky is purple. It's as clear as day. I look up, and my cone cells see the horizon dominated by purples. I've seen it like this for months. It used to be blue like cotton candy and blueberries and baby boy clothes. The sun used to shine down and warm every atom of my face and down to my neck, letting out an involuntary smile from me. But now it's purple like the galaxy, purple like royalty. The clouds are grey and dark, and the sky's aura is one that hurts my soul. I know why it changed, and I know it's not normal. At least, not normal to me. I know it's not because the heat the blue sky gave warmed my soul like hot cocoa and joy, and these purple ones leave my heart frigid and sad, like a child without candy.

People tell me to shift my mindset, that if I exercise enough, blue will eventually return to my vision. If I fix my body enough, it'll be regulated again. I've had water. I've had exercise. I take walks. I do deep breaths. I do affirmations. I reach out to people. I do everything the pamphlets tell me, and all I get is an occasional blotch of blue, the faintest hints that eventually fade in like watercolor to the rest of the purples, covered up. But hey, time heals? Right? Just a few more days, a few more exercises?

The closest to blue I have is when I take medications. People tell me if I take enough of it, it'll mess up my body, my brain, my mind, my cone cells. My doctors tell me to ignore the fear-mongering, that it'll help the blue come to me, and if it doesn't or if it gets more purple, to call them. I take two of them, and one finally helps the sky be partially blue again. Pills with scary names and labels are the ones that help me see the skies people act like missionaries about to me. It's weird how some wellbeing practices that make no dent in helping me see blue make the sky completely bright blue for others, meanwhile the meds that make me slightly blue makes no impact on others.

Why is defeating my cone cells such a risky, unpredictable hassle?

I know that if medications and other exercises help me to see the sky is blue, that it's actually blue, that there's something up with me as opposed to others. I know that the sky is supposed to be blue, but I can't win against my brain, my vision. I know it's not supposed to be purple, because I do not think the strongest, much more anyone, could have survived in nature if everyone went through nights where the purple sunsets hurt like knives. There are too many people with blue skies for my purple to be normal. I know it's not normal, but so little helps me see otherwise. People tell me to get better, to fight, but get better from what? Is this a flu, a car accident, a sickness?

Is what is so obvious to me a sickness? How could so many tell me that my cone cells are valid for seeing purple skies, but also promote the blue skies so heavily over it. Is my vision not valid, not real? Is the sight of purple the presence of a sickness in my brain? Is that why I get recommended wellness advice, because purple is a symptom that I'm sick? Is that why I get told to love myself to treat the purple skies, because it'll alleviate my illness? Is that why medications help, because the chemicals help me see blue in the ways that "I reject purple. I see blue. I only want blue skies. I deserve blue skies." can't? Is my vision really that distorted? 

Are these purple skies that become oh so familar to me sickness that I can't control?

I try to tell myself that one day I will see blue. But how can I imagine warmth and baby blue during the nights when all I have is freezing cold and deep, rich purples? People want me to cling on and have hope during these moments, but 90% of them have never known what it's like to see rich darks surround the clouds in the sky instead of pastel lights. It's hard to truly empathize with those with purple when your skies have only ever been one color. It's impossible to let words have the same impact on my brain as the colors, controlled by hormones that my thoughts can't stop.

People leave when the skies are purple for too long. It leaves an impact on how I act. I wish I could act happy like one of the blues, but the truth is, I can't. I can't see their skies, so I can't act like them. They can't see my skies, so they can't empathize. They all tell me to get better, talk the talk, right before they leave. They get all positive when I don't even want to be here tomorrow to walk the walk. I cling onto what feels like a fantasy: the sky being blue. I barely have anything to make living to see blue worth it. I cling on what feels like incompatibility, trying to live in someone else's reality.

People also tell me that I can do this, I can control this, but I can't. I can tell myself the purple isn't real, but when I look up, I'll still see purple for most of my days and most of the day. I can't control it even when I try. Some people say it's a condition I can control, but I try so hard but most of it doesn't erase the purple. So maybe others are right. It is an illness and a sickness, even if it feels like home to me at this point. The purples are more there to me than the blues are. How can an illness feel so real? Maybe valid is just their way of saying "What you have is real, but not true." but appropriately. But how could my cone cells be wrong? Why would my brain work wrong, why would my brain hurt me? Isn't my brain supposed to help me?

So for now, I take the medications to treat the purple. I do the health and wellbeing exercises just to do them. I look straight up at purple skies and tell myself they're blue and I deserve to see blue. I want to try everything to see blue, even if this purple exists to corrode my soul and dissuade me. I try to believe that my perception is valid and my reality is wrong. And if nothing works, then at least I tried everything, right? I talk to friends who see blue and friends who see half purple half blue, who try to tell me it gets better. It helps a lot, to try to find warmth as much as possible under these cold skies.

To be honest, I like it better when people don't tell me to change my colors. They take me as I am. I know they want me to change my perception, but they know I'm too sick to. They know that it's unrealistic for me to see blue soon, even if they desperately want me to. I like it when they accept that tonight, it'll be purple, and it'll hurt. So I like it when they act as my blue. I like it when they keep me afloat in this stormy sea of hopelessness. They hug me, talk to me, and light me up. They treat me not like a purple, but as a blue, and gently divert my eyes from the sky and its pain. I deeply appreciate the way they so kindly treat me and don't alienate me because of my sickness, but instead show me what blue could look like and remind me why I fight. It makes me want to see blue again, and gives my soul the strength to go on to want to see that day when the whole horizon is warm with blues.

One day, I will see blues. Just not today. And that's okay, because I'm not letting the illness of purple skies win over me, even if it feels genuinely impossible today. And that's the best a purple can do ♡

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: I’m 19 years old and graduated high school last year. I’ve had depression for about 5 years and have been hospitalized for wanting to die and anorexia for about 2 weeks 3 years ago. I’m always having bad thoughts about myself and suicidal thoughts about myself. I wanna die but also don’t wanna die. I’m probably too much of a coward to kill myself aways. I don’t know how but I somehow developed motion sickness and it’s just ruined my life more. I constantly feel nauseous, I don’t go out, don’t go to college, don’t have a job. I’m honestly a pathetic excuse for a 19 year old. I have no passion, ambitions, or motivation. I’m just existing. I have no hobbies either, I stay in bed 24/7 crying myself to sleep almost every night. All of my friends have jobs, college and are so smart, I’m so so proud of them. And then there’s me, useless, pathetic, dumb and betting my mom wish she stopped at 1 kid. I believe she’s growing tired of me even if she doesn’t show it. I’m just so tired of being like this that death feels like the only way to escape. I wrote a suicide note May 1st so I have that ready in case I actually go through with it. I believe that everyone will be happier if I was just gone. I haven’t been happy in years. I keep wishing that I could go back in time and do things differently but that’s not how things work. I keep trying to resist the urge to hurt myself. A couple of weeks ago, I had a breakdown down. My grandmother came upstairs because I had knocked a small table over in my room and found me just laying on the ground sobbing. My mother didn’t know until weeks later and classified it as a “tantrum” I didn’t argue with her about it because there’s no point. I’ve just been going through the motions, waking up, drinking to, eating noddles or whatever else is in the fridge, going back to my room sleep and repeat. My grandmother constantly makes little gabs at me. She once said “Why don’t you go outside and take pictures with your cousin” I’m ugly as fuck so I told her “I don’t do pictures” she proceeded to say “You don’t do much of anything”. It’s been constant little jabs like that that just hurt and don’t help at all, like I get it grandma, I’m a useless person. She favors my brother and all the men in the family anyways. I try not to let it get to me but it does. I don’t speak about my problems to anyone because I don’t want them to have to deal with my stupid shit. I’m just so tired and want it all to end, one way or another. I just don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t want to breakdown again just for it to be classified as a tantrum. I’m just so done with life but too scared to actually die, I don’t know what happens afterwards so that’s why I’m scared of it. Pathetic right? But I’m just a pathetic person. There’s a high chance no one will see this anyways.

Original Idea: I am having days like these when I just get very down whenever I think about my nonexistent personal life. I have 1 active friend online who keeps me company but this friend going away soon for an internship and won't have time much to keep me company and help. I am working on an online business. I have days when I just switch and am in my rational mind and work from day to night. But sometimes, on days like this, I just feel so behind in my personal life and alone. I feel frustrated with my personal and love life. I live in a small town, never been in a big city, did not have the opportunities to find quality people I can call friends. I had mostly surface level casual friends who I felt did not like me much and we did not have things in common. I moved to my parents city again, very uneventful, no people my age. I never had a lasting relationship, I tried dating, it never had any positive result. I been let down badly in few times I had interest in someone, and I been hurt. I am feeling upset at other friend who flirted with me online, never owned up, le dme on, after 2 years he says he wnats to replace me with some other girl he gonna meet locally. I feel frustrated and like my life never changes for better.

Original Idea: Tw: unaliveing mention 


I've seen quite a few unaliveing post as the comments are always saying alone the lines of "Don't do it" and "Keep trying" but why? Do those strangers care about these other strangers? How can you tell someone not to do something when you don't know or understand what's happening in their own life's?

I'm just genuinely curious what goes on in your brain when saying that to someone, and do you think it actually gets through?

Original Idea: I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at 12 years old. I fit the criteria, but I dont feel depressed. I dont think I am. I just worry that my diagnosis, even if its false, could ruin stuff in the future. SSRI's didnt help me, so I stopped taking them. 

I have felt depressed before, but not much. I feel kind of good, I think. When I read my old journals, sure, I seem pretty depressed. But I dont feel like that. I actually feel pretty great. I'm worried the doctors will try make me take them SSRI's again, because my family thinks I should. You wouldnt put a healthy person through chemotherapy, so why do they put me on antidepressants.  

I've been confused for a little while because I mostly feel good. I get sad sometimes, very very sad. Like, suicide risk type of sad. But its usually justified. Most people dont understand that. I felt sad for a little bit earlier today, but then I realized I actually feel  great. I've gotten a bit carried away. I am looking for advice, lol. Is there any way I can get MDD removed fron my medical record, or something?

Original Idea: I hate that i have to shoulder/do everything on my own. My family is shit (basically abandoned me), boyfriends always used or assaulted me, i never have luck with fulfilling friendships. And meanwhile 24/7 the feelings of emptiness and dread. Also suffering through depression for more than 10 years now. And meanwhile...working, daily struggles, humans who love to abuse you. It literally sucks me dry. I only work, eat and sleep. In my free time i'm way too exhausted to do anything fun. I lost my passion and spirit. Basically living like a zombie.

I can't even remember the last i was genuinely happy?! If there would at least be one person i could trust. I hate living so much....you really don't know. Just wanted to rant...

Original Idea: My husband is 62 m and I’m a 49 w. He has cancer has to take medication forever that renders him impotent. It’s nearing 2.5 years of going through all his diagnoses and cancer treatments. We are both depressed and probably it affects his manhood a lot, so he’s retired now and being extra clingy. Last night he got upset that I wasn’t going to bed at the same time as him because I worked 11 hours and my back hurt (I had spine surgery in February) so I was unwinding. I asked him to please put away the leftovers. He just went upstairs to go to bed but came back out to say, also the  litter box needs to be changed, then he went to bed. He also was drinking so the extra controlling side came out. I silently limped around in pain and just cleaned up and finally went to bed with tears streaming down my face. 2.5 years of being treated badly going through my own stuff while taking care of him. Staying by his side in-spite of no affection or intimacy. People never understand how is for the spouse, everything is about the cancer survivor. People just hear the word cancer and forgive that person for anything without understanding nothing is a good excuse to treat people badly. Sick people don’t always treat others very well. He’s not sick but still, his cancer is being well managed. He’s still active and the cancer is remission and has been so since chemotherapy back since within the first 6 months of his diagnosis. He’s still active hasn’t had too many issues, actually he was still drinking through his chemotherapy. He was still working up until July now he’s retired. So now sometimes he smokes weed instead of drinking but still always something. Which I don’t care I just wish he’d treat me better. I had spine surgery in February but I went back to work in May because I was getting too depressed at home. There’s no affection or intimacy and I felt really trapped. He likes to keep me depressed because I think that’s how he thinks he keeps me.

Original Idea: Hi, I’ve been dealing with depression for a few months , diagnosed as major depressive disorder, single episode, situationally triggered. This past year has been full of traumatic events.

I’m no longer suicidal, but I feel emotionally numb, mostly anhedonic, and my anxiety is easily triggered. I’m against taking medication. I’m  functional, though lately I’ve been more fatigued.

My question is: Has anyone here gotten through something like this , without medication or CBT , just using self-help? Especially if you weren’t used to being depressed before.

Original Idea: You always. Fucking. Win. 

You’re the only thing that will never truly leave me. You’re the only constant in my life. 

I have no one. I have nothing. I am alone. Lost. Sad. Broken. 

But I’ll always fucking have you around, like a the devil on my shoulder telling me I’ll never be enough. I’ll never be loved. I’ll never be happy.

Fuck you. 

I try. I really try. I thought I was getting better. I thought I was improving. I spent a couple months HAPPY. I thought it was finally fucking over. 

How stupid I was. 

How silly, to think that I mattered. To think people might care about me. To dare to have the thought that I might help somebody. Maybe somebody could benefit from me. Maybe I can make people happy. 

It’s worse to have experienced a moment of bliss that I’ll never have again. I wish I never got to experience the happiness. 

You win again, depression. You always win. 

Fuck you.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: Hello all - thought I'd come here to dump my sad story. This is pretty extreme so I'd expect some skepticism. Anyways here it goes. 

Some number of years ago, while an undergrad student living with my parents, I experienced a sudden and profound dissociative fugue. When I eventually recovered and regained my wits, I became suspicious of the people I was living with and after some argumentation agreed to go to the hospital. There I was quickly certified by a psychiatrist and diagnosed with Psychosis NOS. I remained on a psych ward for several weeks before being discharged on extended leave (that is, as an involuntary patient not explicitly confined to a hospital). For several more years I remained in the mental health system, all while continuing to function as an adult (studying and working). Eventually I was discharged completely, however more recently it has come to my attention that footage containing myself featuring extreme abuse has been circulating, likely disseminated for monetary gain. A number of other people (co-workers, acquaintances) who have gained some knowledge of my situation have made more or less subtle comments concerning military torture techniques, such as might be used to break a person's will and compel them to commit degrading acts. Others have expressed shock or various other reactions upon (I am assuming) seeing the footage or becoming aware of its existence, however I have not engaged with them regarding this topic. Several have even specifically referenced Kafkaesque situations involving maddeningly complex bureaucratic corruption and the dystopian film *Brazil* (where the protagonist is eventually tortured to insanity). 

In short, I was likely drugged, forced to undergo some form of psychological torture, and then filmed while being abused in a state of enhanced suggestibility or weakened resistance. My initial interaction with *some* of the nurses and doctors in the mental health system leads me to believe that they deliberately misdiagnosed me as an attempt to gaslight and formally discredit me. To top it off, this abuse was perpetrated by my own parents (I am their only child) who managed to dupe most of my other lifetime friends and associates into believing that this was somehow justified as a punitive measure for my bad behavior (which didn't actually exist); the core motivation being monetization of the footage. 

An even more horrific second point: I have also noticed that some of my social media feeds seems to be artificially saturated with disturbing content. I am aware that such feeds will naturally mold themselves around one's digital footprint, however the degree of saturation does not seem commensurate with the degree to which I have searched the relevant themes or topics, these being: powerlessness, torture, abuse, humiliation, corrupt authority figures abusing their power, and some even more specific, such as entrapped/powerless victims attempting to make covert appeals to strangers for aid. I have documented some of these if you would like to see for yourself - as a rough estimate, I'd say that %60-%70 of the content of the relevant feeds have been affected in this manner for the past 8-12 months since it's caught my attention. This could just be coincidental though.

So needless to say I'm pretty bummed out about this. I realize this might sound like an actual schizophrenic delusion to most people, and if anyone wants to question me a bit further I could probably convince you I'm not insane. That being said, the main point of posting this here is to solicit support for the psychological aftermath, so if you want to just take my story for granted and help with that that'd be fine too.

I haven’t suffered from a traumatic event, my depression is so confusing and I feel like an idiot even talking about it because I have ‘no reason’ to be upset.

Original Idea: I was doing great mentally, just some mild stress now and again and I started to get fixated on religion. I started to think about how I don't feel that I desire eternal life because im scared of living forever. I then thought that I felt distrusting of god for this. This caused me to spiral and have intrusive thoughts about killing myself. Now its all i can think of and I go back to school in 2 weeks. I have also has issues with dissocating and feeling detatched from myself. I don't know what to do about this spiral because i feel like im in physical pain and my death is in front of me.

Original Idea: I'm 28. I've been anxious and depressed since I can remember and I've gone through multiple therapists and treatments to help me manage this. I'm getting increasingly anxious that I am going to look back on my life and not remember anything because I cannot connect to people, or a purpose on earth. I'm the classic case. Lovely husband, friends, job, house... but I can't seem to settle into it. When I speak to friends, I feel like no one is really hearing what I'm saying. If I have something good happen to me (wedding, getting a dog, finishing graduate school) I'm never \*in my core\* happy about it. I feel like there's always something off. 

I've always felt like an alien, like my life isn't mine and I'm not in control of my destiny. I have phases of feeling better, but then everything will come crashing down again. I feel no excitement towards the future, only stress and anxiety of the agony I'll face. 

I truly want to feel better. I want to feel like I'm actually here. Does anyone have advice on how to fucking chill out and stop ruining my own life?

Original Idea: I’m tired of being tired I’m so sick of nothing changing and being so sick I can’t leave my bed. At what point is a life just not worth living at what amount of suffering is it ok for me to let go and die so I don’t have to suffer anymore. I mean honestly why the fuck am I alive if I can’t experience good things. What am I even doing anymore days go by then weeks then months then years and instead of getting better it’s like the longer I live the lower the hole I’m in goes. and every time I’m at the bottom and think it can’t get any worse it always manages to surprise me. You wouldn’t want an injured or sick animal to suffer so you put it out of its misery. So why the fuck can’t someone do the same to me

Original Idea: It really truly is mentally exhausting dealing with people, trying to interact with them, it’s like living in a separate world people just genuinely don’t understand the situation I go through, how much i genuinely hate waking up in the morning, getting dressed, commute to work, battle my own thoughts about me not wanting to be anywhere but either in a bed or grave all day, that I’m not good enough for anyone or anything. That dreams are meant to be broken and that nightmares come true, I clock out then mope around all day just to do it all over. I genuinely hate that people are happy and I’m not, I’m not the type of person that would destroy someone’s happiness for my own gain but those seem to be the type of people that I mess with online or not, it’s the type of people that’ll poke a beehive with a stick and then act offended when they get stung, and as a result the beehive gets torn down.
I’m tired of living, I hate all life and I don’t feel like doing anything anymore

Original Idea: My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. Throughout our relationship, he’s ended things with me multiple times, only to beg me to come back. Every time, because I truly love him and can’t seem to let go, I take him back.

He says hurtful things like “know your place” every time I argue back with him and that I should feel lucky to have him. He tells me that “anyone would kill to be me” because I have him every single time I raise an issue with him he calls me ungrateful because he pays a bit more than half of the bill (he agreed to do this because he’s on double my wage and chose the house) and without him I’d have nowhere to live 

In the past two weeks, he’s kicked me out of the flat three times (the tenancy is in his name), leaving me to sleep on the floor at a friend’s place.

This treatment is wearing me down. I feel worthless ; like a piece of shit that can be thrown away whenever he’s done with me. It’s crushing to know that even the person who’s supposed to love me can treat me this way.

I have been bullied all my life school parents partners and I’m starting to think that I actually am what he says I am because how does all this happen to one person without there being a reason

I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die either. I just wish I could disappear. I hate myself I have so much work to do and I vent even being myself to do it because I simply do not care

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: I'm 18. There seems to be so much death and suffering around me and I don't know how to cope with it other than this. I can't tell anyone else, they're having a hard enough time as it is.

My granddad on my mums died at the start of the year. His health had been in decline for a year or 2. Some form of rare aggressive cancer in the end. He was old for the country in which he was born and lived, lived through some quite horrible times. He wasn't that old compared to standards in this country. I went to see him with my mum in December (abroad, so that complicates things) - I sort of wish I hadn't. His brain was fine, he was still fighting, but his body was clearly not in any good way. Because of cultural reasons and his wishes, he was being cared for at home by his daughter (my mum's sister). He was bloated, constant hiccups and other sounds that I don't know how to describe other than if I heard them from a person, I would assume death was soon. When he died, my mum was there, and the rest of my family and I went for the funeral. Buried in a place with a great view of a ridge line of a mountain range that I'm well familiar with.

My mum suffered two miscarriages many many years ago. First she had my brother (now 25), then two miscarriages, then me. They both had to die for me to exist. How the hell am I supposed to deal with that. My dad decided that their shared gravestone would have the top cut with that same ridge line, now visible from my granddad's grave (of course, thats coincidence). So now I look out from my granddad's view onto this ridge, and cannot help but associate it with "I wouldn't exist if they hadn't died". Yet I feel absolutely no attachment or wonder about these siblings. I used to join my mum when she went to the cemetery but I haven't been in a while. She usually cried but I don't know if the pain is fading yet. All I did while she was crying was try to comfort her and wonder why I felt no attachment and was visiting 2 peoples graves who I'd never known.

My grandmother on my mums side is currently in the process of dying. She wasn't handling the slow death of her husband (of like a huge number of years) well. I don't know what she's got, but her memory is gone - she doesn't really know who my mum is, or who I am, but she seems to remember that we were once at least important to her. She was being cared for at home (abroad, again by her daughter, my mum's sister) in her deteriorating state. Again, on my granddad's wishes, she was not to be put in a home. I don't know why my mum and her sister decided to respect that after he died. My grandmother took a knife that she had hidden somewhere after the rest of the knives were removed (supposedly) and cut up some furniture, apparently attempting to protect my mum's sister's daughter's daughter (age something like 5) who lives in the same house. My mum's sister had to call the police because what else do you do in that case. So she was removed to a mental hospital, then has recently been released to some old peoples care home, which, if you're thinking like one in the UK or somewhere, is not. There's 3 elderly people all in one not great room, minimal carers. But whatever, it's what's expected in that country. She's lost her mind and she's basically now just skin draped over some bones. My mum's sister visits her everyday, as does my mum when she's there.

My mum has suffered though this of course. But because they're abroad, there's of course the consideration that whenever she sees them might be the last. So she's constantly travelling back and forth. When she's here, she has at least two (loud video) calls a day, usually 45 mins long each, with her sister, plus maybe one every few days with her sister's daughter. The phone calls usually are her sister reporting my grandmothers condition and deterioration. Of course they are usually emotional. Often this interrupts whatever little family time we're having, often meals. She never asks before but sometimes apologisies after, and I never say anything. It's not ok.  This makes it feel like whenever she's here, she's not really. I tried to tell her this isnt good for her mental health, but of course, its more nuanced than that and that means we have fallen out over this. But it means she's bringing all the death and suffering into this house, or leaving to be abroad, meaning no stability. It's also ruined one holiday: we had planned to take some time out in the same country abroad, just the 4 of us to escape - my mum didn't go because my granddad supposedly wouldn't make it a week and she wanted to be there for him. It took another 7 months for him to die. I know that things like that can't be estimated, and I don't blame her for wanting to be near her dad. But we had gone through years of ups and downs at this point, at least 2 death scares a year. And still my mum rides the ups and downs and reacts impulsively. But I don't blame her. A recent holiday (a rare one not to the same country abroad) was in jeopardy because my grandmother might not have survived the week. Again, she did. But I don't know what I would do if I was in my mum's position.

My grandmother on my dad's side died a few years back. I don't really remember her in any good condition. Diabetes and brain troubles towards the end. Took her about 8 years or so to die. Spent a large number in multiple care homes, and more being cared for at home by my grandad on my dad's side.

My other grandad has just been diagnosed with something weak heart. Which is normal for aging. But he's doing alright so far at least, although his sight and hearing is declining. 

Someone else in my family on my dad's side that I had never met died the other day. In hospital. Don't know the full story, but he had been alone and refused pretty much any social interaction for many years. So died with no close relatives, no comfort. Already my parents are talking about some kind of problems with his will.

I work at a fast food place. There was a guy there in kitchen that I never really talked to much (language barrier), but we always said hello to each other whenever we saw each other. Nice guy. I came in one evening not long ago for work. He had died unexpectedly the previous evening (I think at home, maybe in his sleep). Not nice, but it happens. Had an assembly at my school a few days later where they give out awards to people. Called a name out for a girl who was in year 10. Didn't show up. Saw her name on the screen. Same surname. Very unique surname as well. Her dad died while working 6 years in a boring meaningless job just to try and support her and maybe trying to save for some time in the future with her. Never got it. I mean you hear all the time that you should enjoy life and not take it for granted. But in reality everybody does take it for granted - we have to work. Some people have to work more than others and get nothing from life in return. Yet I'm still working there, not often socialising because I struggle in those situations. 

On holiday a couple years ago to see the family abroad for one week. Left our cat with my brother at our house (he hadn't moved out by that point), because he didn't come. He died the morning on the day we got back, just before we got back. Not sure what happened, maybe clipped by car, maybe a heart attack, but he was not injured. Found by a neighbour who initially tried to take him to our house, but my brother didn't hear the door, so he took him to the vet. My mum got that phone call while we were travelling back. 

And now my mum's talking about moving back abroad when she gets a bit older. And I'll be having to make these same decisions to stay or go when she inevitably gets ill (assuming she doesn't die soon). 

My grandad died of a cancer that might be genetically passed down to my mum, me and my brother. Who knows what that'll come to, but that's not nice to find out - and im not sure my parents are aware that im aware. I think they told my brother but didn't realise I could hear.

At the same time, I'm struggling to have any self esteem to socialise. I guess that this and due to other circumstances. When it comes up in conversation rarely with my mum, and things being implied so it's a bit difficult to reproduce any conversation here. But basically, I talk about a girlfriend, which I dont have. Yet repeatedly my mum always responds with "... or a guy, I don't mind". I'm straight. I don't know why she feels the need to say its ok if I'm gay. I've said I'm straight, I have always been straight. I assumed it was just my mum trying to be weirdly accommodating. But then I was at another family gathering on my dad's side, which I tried to avoid but was forced to attend. I don't remember how it came up, but it was going down a similar path, and my dad's brother's daughter said "... or guy". Do I come off as gay? Is it because I don't have a girlfriend yet? Why are people being overly accommodating when I'm never mentioning being gay?

I don't know how to handle this. When I was visiting my mum's mum in the care home, another of my mum's sister's daughter's asked me if I had seen was scary. I said it wasn't. It wasn't. I have been exposed to this too much now that suffering before death seems normal and learning someone has died is relieving. Or makes me question why we accept living in this way. Yet we'll all still accept it. Is it normal to exposed to this at age like 13?

If anyone from my family finds this, if anyone then my brother (who's avoided the worst of it by moving out and having a girlfriend and full time job), then I guess it's all out. But I don't know if that would make things easier or not?

Original Idea: I’m a 21 M that feels like I’ve completely lost my identity after years of trying to mask my pain. The thoughts of suicide and self harm have reappeared within the last month after they took some time off. Trying to tell myself it will get better but idk how much longer I can take the pain of life. Hope y’all don’t feel the same.

Original Idea: Preface: I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit to post this in. Feel free to take it down if it is not.

I've got a good education, finished a bachelor in CS and pursuing a master's now. I managed to hold down a good job for a while, but ended up quitting to focus on my studies. I've got a supportive mom who helps me stay afloat.

And yet I just can't bring myself to function like a normal human being. I don't know how so many people go about their lives, ticking like clockwork. They dutifully go through the motions every day, they have a set time to prepare food, a set time to mow the lawn, a set time to clean their house, etc., and every single week they go through with everything.

I almost can't bring myself to do anything on a schedule. I can only really function doing things on a here-and-now basis. If the apartment is unclean, then maybe the 10th time I feel guilty about it, I'll finally get around to actually cleaning the place. If I'm dangerously close to running out of clean underwear, I'll wait until almost the last possible moment to actually wash the stuff and avert catastrophe.

Whenever I get into a proper routine, it almost always ends up crashing into a wall of "what's the point". Why spend so much of your precious limited time on this earth cleaning this stupid thing, when you could be doing something else.

The rest of my time, I just try to escape. When I was a kid, there wasn't really much of anything for me to do at home; my parents are divorced, and my single mom had to work her ass off to support us. So once I was done with the schoolday and homework, I would just disappear from this world. I would watch YouTube or cartoons all day, just to forget that I existed.

I think that was partially what got me into CS, because while programming you can just lose yourself in the task at hand, and forget about everything around you.

Eventually I decided that I didn't want to run anymore, and I wanted to build a life that I actually want to live for myself. And no sooner had I come dangerously close to being actually happy, than covid hit, and the lockdowns and online schooling were like a wave that obliterated the sandcastle that I had built for myself.

Now I feel like I will never be happy, like there is no happiness for me to be found in this world, like I was not meant for it. I keep making attempts at it, but it's mostly a swing and a miss. I just seemingly can't find a place where I'll fit, where I'll feel like the puzzle piece that completes the whole. I feel unnecessary to most places, and unnecessary to the world. I don't know why, I just don't feel at home.

Talking with people helps sometimes, and sometimes maybe not. My mom has done more than anyone else for me in this world, and yet sometimes when I ask for advice or am vulnerable with her, the response I get feels as if someone has just poured a bucket of ice cubes into your bath. So cold and matter-of-fact, that you lose your entire breath and shrivel up.

Yet other people somehow seem to get on with life. And I don't really know how.

I don't really have any goal in mind with this post. It's just a scream into the void.

Original Idea: 31F here. I've had depression on and off since I was a teen but this year has been the worst. I think I expected my 30s to be better than my 20s, but I've never felt more stuck than I do now.

I am a freelance musician and have dedicated almost my whole life to being a violinist. When I graduated school, COVID-19 hit and I lost all my contracts. I decided to pivot and spent a few summers trying to get pre-requisites for medical school and volunteer experience. When the gigs started coming back (I mostly sub for orchestras) then I sort of put medical school on hold and started freelancing again. I really regret this decision.

Due to the upcoming recession, a lot of orchestras are tightening budgets. I had a good few years, but now I've found myself being left out of work that I had gotten in the past. It feels personal, like I have done something wrong and that's why they don't want me. I have barely anything scheduled for the fall, when last year I was really busy. I have also just been left out of a few gigs that I used to be hired for because someone better came along. It's a tough reality to cope with in this industry. My self worth hinges on the work that I get, and I know it's not healthy. I regret not picking a different area to study. Being a musician means that I work really hard for almost no money and none of it ends up mattering anyway because there's always someone that they decide they want instead. There is no loyalty. No matter how hard I work, it's never enough.

If I leave the industry, I'll feel like a quitter. But I can't imagine doing this for the rest of my life either. I guess it feels even worse now because I'm starting to get to the age where all my friends are getting married and having kids so they don't talk to me anymore. I have a bad relationship with my family and my relationship with my partner is a bit rocky right now. I feel like things should be better because I worked so hard, and they aren't. When I wake up I get hit with a sense of dread, like how can I keep living with this despair day after day. The only thing that's stopping me is that my roommate committed suicide when I was in university and I remember the absolute chaos and sadness it caused for everyone around her, and that I'm scared of it hurting. I haven't decided yet which method to use because they all seem painful and not 100% foolproof.

  
Thank you for listening to my inner thoughts. I know my situation probably isn't that bad but I am feeling worthless and alone. I just hope this feeling passes before I end things but I know it probably wont.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: I have in the past spiralled but for the most part I'm high-functioning. I wash myself if I need to be somewhere, brush my teeth every day, try my best to eat and socialise, show up to work, etc. Yet, my room is a total mess and I feel absolutely no joy or hope in my life. I have constant dread, anxiety, and this heaviness in my soul. When I get home I pretty much just wait for the day to end. 

I feel as though because I'm functional I've been overlooked by a lot of psychiatrists and doctors. I was told that I'm doing well because I'm doing the bare minimum. When I point out to them that I feel like a walking husk, aimlessly stumbling through the world, I am reminded that at least I'm still taking care of myself. I was even once told by a former therapist that adult life isn't what kids think it is, and it's full of mundanity and disappointment. The only mental health professional that hears me is my current therapist. 

I also feel that my feelings are overlooked sometimes because I don't come into the doctor's/psychiatrist's office sobbing or shaking. I'm pretty dissociated from my feelings and, while I can explain them, for the most part they don't show in my body. Maybe because I'm so matter-of-fact about my feelings it's assumed that I'm faking it. 

Honestly, it's so frustrating and exhausting. Why is the marker for good mental health productivity? Why isn't my happiness important? I'm not asking to be euphoric all the time, just to feel okay. 

I know there's hope and that's why I'm still here. It just sucks feeling like not many people understand.

Original Idea: There definitely more people that have it worse than me and are struggling more than me. The problem is, I'm a weak person, I'm tired of living on with constant financial instability. Constantly worrying if I can afford next month or the month after that. Constantly worrying if I actually have a future ahead if me or I might just end myself.

What's the point of all of this? I'm struggling, I'm tired and I just want to end myself. It's like forcing someone to continue playing a game they don't enjoy. Why do I keep living? I feel like I've already taken the wrong turn in life and I can't get out. I made my choice and I'm stuck with that choice. I'm in too deep and I'm tired of taking a different turn. What if that choice is pointless too? What if I'm just slowly sinking and spiriling down until eventually I couldn't take it anymore? 

I'm tired. I'm not looking for advice, I just want to vent

Original Idea: TW: Self harm, if that wasn't already clear

I've already done it once in 2022, but my scars are so thin and light that even I can barely make them out from my skin. I don't want that, I want more. I've had the idea of doing it again floating about in my mind every moment since then, but as of the last maybe year and a half, it's become more of a craving rather than just something I'd like to do. I can't imagine my body not being covered in scars, from the chest, to the thighs, to the arms and sometimes even the face. I don't realize these fantasies because I hate to see my parents crying or asking if they can do anything to help. I'm not even meaning this as a means to get help, let alone to kill myself, it's just my body and I want it to look like that, same way you can cut your hair, get plastic surgery or go to the gym. I've recently come to realize that even I find them attractive even in other people. Someone with these marks, they've struggled as I do, maybe even more, and that's hot. They're real. I want to be real too. I want people to see me, and to not just think I'm a coward who can't handle feelings when "Everyone feels that way". I want people to be able to clearly see this, so that people who are down can find me like a light amidst a thick veil of mist and know I won't judge or hurt them like everyone else seems hell-bent in doing. Call it what you will, but I see these scars as reassuring, they tell the tale of despair that so many wouldn't notice otherwise, and tell me that you're approachable, because you, at the very least, have seen the world through the same lens I do. The only time I've felt comfortable in so long was amidst people who were down in the gutter, and I want those people to find me again, regardless of what everyone else might think of me.

Original Idea: Since I was 15 I have always felt alone (M26 now), even though I have friends. It really hurts me to wake up in the morning and not see any messages, or even at the end of the day to see that no one has sent me at least a "hello." I'm dating someone but she doesn't want to be my girlfriend (yet, she doesn't feel ready) and I feel unloved. I haven't spoken to her in two days and she hasn't asked me anything. I see my friends married, with children, and happy even though life hits them hard. She'll probably break up with me or I'll break up with her, I don't think it will last more than a month.

I consider myself a normal person, I always make my friends and those around me laugh, I like to make others happy. But nobody wants to make me happy. I really have very low standards for dating or making friends. I get attached easily to anyone who shows me some affection and even then I can't get someone. If I were someone physically ugly I could understand it, but that's not the case.

I live with my parents and don't have a job. My mother emotionally abuses me, calling me useless, lazy, and worthless. When in reality, I love working and feeling useful. In my previous job they even nicknamed me "Saint Gaetano" (He is the saint of work). Only now I'm depressed and I have a hard time working and doing activities.

Original Idea: (didn’t know a sub to post this is but alr) but gosh I am so close to hating my sister my parents wanted me to stay with her for a WHOLE ASS YEAR so they can move then when I am finally able to move my dream is ruined by her going with me… like bitch why are you here I’m the only one who’s meant to be here but some of you might be asking “what did she do?” To sum it up basically what she did is lock me in a room for 13 hours if not more in a day, only Feeds me once a day, bloody pads everywhere and sometimes shit in the toilet (not outside Atleast) but she also keeps blaming me for shit I didn’t even do and all she does is yell at me. Also we had 5 whole days to pack our stuff and when the day finally comes she’s straight up pissed yelling at my brother and I because “WERE GONNA BE LATE” and after I had to be awake for 2 days (same with my brother) she then calls my stuff “junk“ WHEN ALL I HAD WAS CLOTHES,1 SET OF LEGOS AND BOOKS,…… while she had 4 suitcases worth of stuff and I had a tiny backpack that I couldn’t even put my clothes i Had for years inside my backpack. Time skip when To when we finally get there I asked her “ why are you even here if all you do is complain about being here when you’ve been here a dozen times in your 22 years of living?“ then she has the audacity to say “ so I can help you “ WITH WHAT EXACTLY. And btw she always compares me to some random kids at my old school I haven’t been for a year that I don’t give any shits about and she expects me to have a 3.8 gpa when I grow up. at this point she should go back to fucking Maryland or wherever she wants to go so do y’all have any advice to confront her or talk about her with my parents (horrible grammar by the way

Original Idea: This is just a vent into the void.
Im in my mid 30s and been depressed since im 11 or 12 years old.
I think i got destroyed twice in life and never really recovered.
No matter where i am i feel out of place and think everyone else would have a better time without me.
I never went to any partys or occasions, never had a relationship and never got intimate with someone.

One of the main reasons why im still here said that if the life has no joy maybe it should end.
And i cant find any reason anymore not to just leave.

I just wanted to type it out to someone since there is nobody i can talk to.

Original Idea: i have no where to share this and maybe no one will ever read this but i want to let it out. 

i was having a mental breakdown today and sobbing in a dark alley leading to a main road where no one would see me (at least i thought). i had a sudden intrusive thought to end it all by running onto incoming traffic and right at that moment, a kid from the house above suddenly yelled from the window asking “who are you? who is this person running?”

i immediately turned back and started sobbing even harder. i wasn’t going to act on the thought, but that innocent kid unknowingly saved me in that moment.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: i have been living with depression for over 8 years now. it started when i was 11 with a sudden death of my beloved cat, who was the only creature i felt safe with. living in a constant loneliness and silence this cat was the only thing that gave a sense of joy, love and company. he was like a child to me, the younger brother who i wanted to protect from everything no matter what. but he died of cancer and with him died my ability to hope for the better, to develop a loving and happy relationship. the second thing that fell down on me was the realization of my homosexuality that lead me to abandon myself and create a new personality in a fear of my true self's disclosure. after these two accidents i was never the same and still trying to deal with these traumas today. all these years before 2022 i had been living in isolation and battling asthenia that fell upon me after the first depressive episode at 11. i couldn't think, i couldn't read and couldn't concentrate on anything but what a failure a became and the dissociation from my body that made me a husk of a person i once was.,

 i'm ukrainian, so i left the country after the war broke out and a month before the war my mental state had begun to worthen. first panick attacks and the constant feeling that i was going to die shortly. this state really bloomed when i became a refugee in europe where my second depressive episode truly began. every day, every minute i had the thoughts that i needed to die because i regarded my self as misery of my family and a worthless creature that didn't deserve a life. at this time i started going to therapy and got diagnosed with depressive personality disorder. i started taking sertralin and this a year went by. then i found a different psychiatrist and with her help i sarted a new course of quetiapin and carbomazepin, because i had seizures and hallucinations quite often, now living in germany as a refugee. still very isolated with my family who abused me and blamed me for their problems. around this time i started to drink alcohol, while being on a high amount of pills and got addicted to alcohol to drink away the loneliness and abuse inflicted on me. a had a suicide attempt around that time. a year ago i went to czech republic to study english philology at the uni. this education and time spent studying for this were one of the britest moments in my life but unfortunately there is a chance of me being deported because of me assisting the money laundering. see, i have become a victim of a scammer on the internet who used my bank account to launder crypto money. he stole around 5k euros and when i went to the police they started to suspect me of assistance. while the prosecution is going on, i'm ok but if they accuse me, i have a chance of going to prison up to one year and deportation. the most heavy thing for me is that this whole sutation could influence my studying, the thing for what i worked so hard is about to be taken from me and it's very hard for me to comprehend the shit i have got into. this whole situation felt like anouther dream i had at night where som eof my relatives died or i've been exposed or laughed at. but it was real. 

i wish i was dead right now but i have the mother who would probably end her life too if i ended mine. i don't know why i wrote this whole thing down, i'm sorry for your time

Original Idea: I’m 27, (f), I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer this year, as well as degenerative disc disease. I was born with muscular dystrophy and a congenital heart disease. My heart has gotten significantly worse due to the disease and stress. I want to give up. I don’t give up on anything, I keep trying until I get it right. But man, I’ve been trying for 27 years, I simply don’t want to anymore. I’m exhausted, I’m in pain (emotionally and physically). I need a miracle. I feel alone. I’m afraid to talk about how I truly feel. I say truly because I do talk about how I feel, to an extent. But nobody knows my true and raw feelings/thoughts. It never ends well whenever I do finally get everything off my chest. No matter who I talk to, it never ends well for me. Even if I’ve spent all day prepping myself on how to display my emotions, and how to communicate properly, it just goes south. I’m dying and I don’t want to spend however long I have left on this earth feeling hopeless and worthless. I’m tired of being anxious, I’m tired of being overworked and overwhelmed. I don’t want to do this anymore.

I want to top my class but for some reason my performance just isnt here and I feel completely dead inside  
No excitement, fear or anything, just like watching the world through a window

Original Idea: My boyfriend and I are both 16 and have been together for over a year and were friends before that, he has been depressed since about january of this year and has asked his parents for therapy or to try and get meds but they don't know the severity of the situation and haven't been acting as fast as one would hope (not saying they're bad parents- it's just hard to tell the people caring for you how unhappy you really are, ya know? They only know a part of what he's going through). This morning he told me that he's not sure if he feels love for me anymore because of his depression, and also that he had a dream where he told me things he "doesn't really like (about me)" but won't tell me what they are because he doesn't want me to have to change.. but that's side tracking a bit. I told him I would be there to support him no matter what and that we could take a break or do whatever he needs right now with our relationship (to which he just said act how we normally do), I have sent him "self esteem journals" and therapy type worksheets but I'm not sure how often he really does them.. I've even gone as far as to introduce more niche types of therapy like age regression but that took too much effort for him to get into despite it seeming to help once or twice. How else can I help him? Will his love ever come back or should I accept it and just support him as a friend? I'm willing to do anything for him.. despite the dwindling goodnight messages and petnames that are dropping like flies, I have never stopped showing my love but I just feel so stuck and scared for both him and us. Is there anything I can do or people who have been through similar situations with their partner?

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: I have been struggling with depression and high stress lately, and it’s been hard to find anything that helps me feel calmer or more balanced. I recently heard about a place called Green Dragon ,  I haven’t visited, and I’m not asking for advice or recommendations.

I’m mostly sharing because I feel stuck and could use support or encouragement from people who understand what it’s like to cope with ongoing depression. Any experiences, thoughts, or words of empathy would really help.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: Hi everyone. 

I am new here. 43f struggling with depression.

I am basically my mother's caretaker. She's been ill, and I take her to all of her medical appointments, help her with her daily tasks, make sure she eats, etc etc. I love my mom and want her well, so I do this, but it hasn't been easy. I have struggled with my mental health most of my life, and I feel like her health issues and my constant worry is making me so much worse. I have always been depressed, but never like this. I truly feel hopeless, like things will never be good. I am off in the summer, but most of it has been spent taking care of her and worrying about her constantly. I feel trapped and don't see a way out. 

Not only am I depressed, I am angry. I have two sisters and they don't help much. I feel like it's all on me. My mental health is declining day by day. I even snap at my mother a lot because I cannot deal...and then I feel guilty. And then I snap again. A vicious cycle.

I know I need help, but I don't know where to start. It's been so bad that I just wanted to go to the hospital but what will she do if I am not here?

Sorry this post is all over the place. I am just venting.

Thanks for reading.

Original Idea: 
I despise my appearance, and I honestly don't know what to do about it. I have an ugly face, terrible hair, small penis, weird head shape. I really hate how I look, and honestly it has been driving me insane. I know I need to learn how to love myself, but I don't think I'll ever be able to do so without being able to look good. It's driving me crazy, and it's making me become a worse person. The little personality I had is being drained by my hatred towards my own body. I'm scared of what I'll do to myself

Original Idea: I was a sweaty person even before the antidepressants but they made it so much worse, a heat wave and a meds mess-up is making it so much worse now. I'm so sick of dripping in sweat as soon as I move, makes my anxiety go nuts at work when I know I'm probably stinky due to this. 

I obviously use antiperspirant and deodorants, stay clean, try to stick to breathable clothing, I've used the likes of odaban as well as the maxi deodorants off shelf. I feel its beyond useless trying to talk to my GP about this again, not much available on the NHS either.

Original Idea: I just find it really difficult to make friends. Ever since I was younger I struggled with the social aspects of life much in thanks to my depression and anxiety. I still do my best to hang out with people, but I seem to give off depressing vibes to most because people usually don't care to call back. This has basically made the romantic side of life dryer than the Sahara Desert for me lol. I often try to ignore this and stay isolated, focus on work, studies you name it, but at the end of the day I just wish things could be different.

Original Idea: 
I've been thinking a lot about myself lately, and I think I’m really going to die alone, family members are distant from me except for one, but I just don't feel enough, and I don't even know what I want from life or what I'm even aiming for. I'm in the same position a year before I am 20 now, and I'm feeling envious of others who are talking and having a good time socialising while I'm stuck in my head. It feels like I'm just going through this terrible life of mine till I die.

## Mental Health - Depression
Original Idea: I’m 19 going into my sophomore year of college. I feel kind of miserable and lost in life. I feel guilty for feeling this way but I don’t know what to do.

I get nervous whenever I think about my future. For some reason, it’s like I can’t see myself being successful. Im not passionate about my current major and I feel like my motivation has gone down significantly. I honestly have no idea what I’m doing in my life and I feel completely behind everyone else. 

On top of that, I feel immense guilt for not having things figured out. I’m a first gen student and my parents have always expected me to have things figured out. I thought I did but now, I’m not sure. My parents have worked their asses off to give me this opportunity and I don’t want to let them down. I want to make them proud but I’m constantly battling my mental health and I just don’t know what to do.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Breathing techniques can influence your physiological state and your psychological condition. A systematic review\* highlighted the relationship between slow breathing and various physiological and psychological outcomes. The review found that slow breathing techniques can lead to changes in heart rate variability (HRV), electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns, and brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

For instance, during slow breathing techniques, there is often an increase in HRV, which is associated with parasympathetic nervous system activity. This increase in HRV is linked to decreased anxiety, relaxation, and improved emotional control. Additionally, slow breathing can lead to increased alpha power and decreased theta power in EEG readings, indicating a state of relaxation and reduced mental arousal.

These physiological changes can have a direct impact on your psychological state. For example, a study\*\* found that during slow breathing, there was a negative correlation between HRV and brain activity in certain regions, which are involved in emotional processing and cognitive control. This suggests that slow breathing can modulate emotional and cognitive processes.

Moreover, the review noted that slow breathing can lead to increased comfort and relaxation, as well as positive mood changes.

**In summary, slow breathing techniques can lead to changes in HRV and brain activity, which can be noticed as increased relaxation, reduced anxiety.**

I was the type of person to think such things won't work for me. But then I thought "why am I being so arrogant? It's scientifically proven. It should work on all humans that breathe".

**What type of breathing? Psychology Today reported that just 2 minutes of deep breathing with a longer exhale can increase HRV.**

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: To make a long story short, I am very insecure about myself. I sometimes consider myself to be ungrateful and mean, and I know I’m not really like this and I always tend to talk to AI like ChatGPT as obviously they will always validate my feelings, but I need a response from a human. Another thing is that I always feel like I’m too different. Like any action that I do that doesn’t lineup with what anyone else might do, I feel like I’m doing something wrong. I don’t know how to properly seek validation because I grew up never knowing how to communicate because I grew up in a sheltered household with my dad always trying to take care of my mom who had chronic depression and would occasionally physically abuse me(she doesn’t anymore, but I still think about the times that she did). And I always feel like something has to be my fault but everyone reassures me that it’s not I get that they try to make me feel better, but it just doesn’t make me feel like I impact anything. 
So basically that’s all the big ones.
I hope whoever ever reads this has a good day.❤️
Stay safe out there !

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: I don't know if this is the right subreddit to say such things

Yes, I have to specify he’s Arab bc if there’s anyone who would sympathize with me it's my fellow Arabs experiencing the Arab dad trauma. I wouldn’t say he’s abusive so I’m getting that out of the way. Ever since we were young he would explode into a screaming and throwing things mess whenever he gets angry. So my siblings and I learned from a young age how to avoid him when he’s like that. It’s not like we’re purposefully getting on his nerves, he’s just not in the mood sometimes and would ask us to do something or get him something, and if we were late by a millisecond or asked him to repeat what he said, he would start huffing in annoyance. And if you dared to be scared or stressed and say you couldn’t hear him because he’s always like this, he would start throwing things at you and asking you to get off his face, and that he would do the work himself. We’re low class so if we dared to complain, my mom would always tell us he’s done everything for us and puts us above his needs. And that he’s like that and we should just ignore him. I’ve told her multiple times that I couldn't give two shits about materialistic things, all I care about is him being emotionally available and stable. This has made me grow to become a 22-year-old girl whose first instinct at any minor inconvenience is to physically hurt herself. How do I deal with this? I’m literally so confused like today he asked me to get things and I went around the house bc I didn't understand where he said I would find them and when I found them I asked him if he wants me to wash them, he started screaming saying he's tired of waiting and where I went so I asked him again if he wants me to wash them and he said to just bring them, I brought one I was already holding and was about to go get the other when he asked where the other was and I told him it was too heavy for me to carry them both so i’ll go get it now, he said something about my attitude and I said “I didn't say anything, you're screaming and i’m trying to figure out what you want” then he threw the nearest thing at me (his favorite move, he doesn’t care what’s that thing, all he cares about is that it’s something big enough to throw it at us) and thankfully it was just a tissue box. He threw it with all his might but i moved away so it didn’t get me. Then he told me to get off his face. I know I get anxious and can’t control the way my voice may come off but I wasn’t raising my voice or anything, just a bit annoyed with this screaming. I literally can’t talk about it to anyone without them blaming me or saying that he’s like that and I should just move on and not let it get to me. But how long do we have to endure this? Why isn’t he like any other normal dad?

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: My partner used to treat me badly, he was sexually and emotionally abusive.

We broke up at some point for a few months, than we got back together. We reconciled in November 2024. But then in January 2025, we had a horrible fight again. I tried to cut my wrists that night, but he stopped me. That's when something changed. I could feel he was scared. I remember he got me into bed, and held me in his arms throughout the night. He didn't let go, not even for a second.

Ever since that night, something changed. At first I thought it wouldn't last. He slowly became more reliable. Then he started becoming more affectionate. He became more understanding, more patient, more forgiving, more trusting. One day, he was looking at me, and could feel *love*. Love. I felt loved. And I've felt it other times since.

I know he loves me, there is no doubt for me about that anymore. But sometimes, when I am alone, something in me won't give me peace. Sometimes all the abuse he inflicted on me goes through my mind again. It's like I am living it all over again. Sometimes I'm at work and something comes over me, and I end up sobbing for a few minutes. Sometimes, when he is asleep next to me, I find myself awake, revisiting everything that happened, feeling all the pain again, and I just cry silently for a while. Then I get to hug him, I get to be held, and it's all good again.

I can't stand this anymore, my mind just won't let me forget what happened and accept that he has changed. We both have changed, and we are both making an effort to be good to each other. I just wish I could make the memory of all the pain go away.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Hi, so I'm a teenager (not saying my age), backstory starting when I was about 7 years old my dad abandoned me and the family for other women repeatedly, then coming back, leaving like a cycle. I currently live with my father but see my mom a lot.
This made me now have daddy issues, I also have anxiety and depression both due to this, and other stuff. 

When I was 9 maybe, my mom decided to tell me about my dad hooking up with a woman about a year before meeting my mom, resulting in the woman getting pregnant, my mom is 100% convinced that the child is my dad's. My dad gets super angry and irritated whenever I mention this woman and "The child", which I think is super suspicious. My dad and his side of the family all think the woman only wanted to get money out of my dad and was lying. My mom thinks the child IS my dad's and that the woman got pissed off at my dad for not sending money so therefore just moved on without him. 

Lately, I've been trying to find pictures of said child who is supposed to be around my age so I can compare if she looks anything like me or my dad, but I can't find anything

The only answer I see to be able to move on from this is, I made a "secret account" on Instagram, with the intention of adding this woman and trying to find anything that has anything to do with the child, I'm not planning on writing anything specific yet, I just want to see if it could be possible that I have a sister I never knew about.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Throughout all my early childhood and into being a teenager my older brother would beat the shit out of me every week when he lost his temper. I feel as though I severely push to be a pacifist because that horrible torture leaves a mark on you. Him and my cousin used to drown me for fun. As they laugh at the torture they put me through. This was a time before cameras at least in the casual surveillancing technology of the modern times. I think aside from the torture they would inflict on me the hardest part was having none of your family care. I fucking hate these people for their complicity in cases. At the same time I love my mum, what is this damn Stockholm syndrome. I kind of forgot about all this until I was talking to some friends sharing experiences of having siblings and why I think siblings are terrible. Then none had a similar story all wanting siblings and then there's me... I'm attending my youngest sister's wedding next week and my eldest brother and abuser will be present... I'm losing my mind thinking about attending her wedding and him being there. I forgot to mention he was fucking my gf of 6 years for the entire 6 years 👀. She was cheating on me with him and many others from the get go. On my 18th birthday she at the age of 17 and I at the age of 18 fucked my brother and his best friend when I had gone to sleep. I forgot to mention that he is 4 years older than me or 22 at the time. We had got together at 16 when she was 15 and I was 16. She was the year below me and she was seemly fine. But boy did she have a fucking temper. She would hit me, punch me, scratch me for anything she would perceive me doing wrong. If I had any friends that were women she'd abuse me. Reliving this is hard, but perhaps not as hard as forgetting... There's loads more but idk do y'all think this is an over reaction to still have these night terrors and nightmares over this level of trauma. I've never hit my brother as much as he has deserved it. I try and think that makes me stronger than him that I don't need to succumb to his level of violence. I undoubtedly could being twice his size, practise bjj and boxing. But maybe my need to improve my fighting skills was to allow no-one to hurt me again. I left my partner of 2 years because I got scared that she would hurt me. So I left before that could happen. This was 3 months ago and I think about her every day. I'm not better than the kid who was beaten and battered back then... this may be too negative but at least it's insight. I am better than ever I have a successful business and I'm driven fuck everyone who looked away at the abuse I took.

Original Idea: I am Prakhar and I am 17 years old. Last night, I saw my sister getting f***ed by my father... And i am traumatized now. Let me tell you what happened exactly.

My mother was out of the town because of her usual work. And my father is currently retired. My elder sister is 26 years old and she's married. She came back to home because me and my dad needed someone to take care of us, as both of us don't know how to cook and other little things. Last night, i woke up and went to the bathroom to have a piss. Just then i heard some sounds coming from my father's room. There was a hole in the door through which i decided to see what's happening inside. That's when i saw my sister and my father n@ked, having $ex. She was lying on the bed and my father was f**ing her. They were doing missionary! I really didn't know how to react. I just went back to my room and tried to sleep, but it didn't help. I couldn't sleep last night and i am heavily traumatized. What to do?

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Hi! That’s my first time venting on Reddit or even to an alive person about this. There was something that wasn’t the worst thing that happened to me because I was actually abused aside if that and it’s that much of trauma as of unpleasant situation that happened to me but I need a people opinion to hear that I’m not imagining that it was bad and just to try waters before I vent about anything else I guess.
When I was 15(f) I often stayed over nights at the place of family’s and well mine friend - also a woman, and actually rather grandma if you will because she is in her 60s. And she “adult” pressured me into drinking alcohol with her. She had a lot of various alcohol at her place but I think she was rather impulsively buying it than drinking as much. But she’d drink it alone and she’d ask me if I want too, and first time I said yes because I thought it’s cool to try. She poured me the whole glass - not a small portion “to try” but a normal glass of what - i don’t even know. She’d call it mock tail because she’d mix it with pop+fruit juice or something else literally saying that it’s just “to take the edge off” but it’s definitely had alcohol in it and and enough to feel it. I don’t think I finished it. But then after that she’d offer it to me every time. And not “offer” offer. She’d get offended when I’d say I don’t want to. She’d demand explanation and argue with me. And as being a depressed refugee kid at that time (part of the reason how I’d even end up at her place) I didn’t had enough emotional strength to keep an argument and felt trapped and obligated because it’s at her home so I’d do it just for peace sake. Once I think I had to pour it out while she didn’t see. After the glass is gone she’d offer me another again arguing that it’s just a light alcohol so why am I so against it. To be bit more fair - I was 15 and it was in Germany - country where you can drink beer and wine when you 16. But it was neither of these things (still wonder what was it - but seemed like el or vodka or whiskey - I just know she’d mix normal alcohol with pops or fruit juice) - and I clearly stated that I don’t want to. Also she knew my parents would disapprove so she’d say that we wouldn’t tell them and that’s this’d be between us. I know it may sound like she was trying to be the “cool aunt” or whatever but it made me feel weird and bad, not to mention that making (and I mean - making because she’d continue to pressure me when I would say I don’t want to) a minor drink decent amount of alcohol when they clearly uncomfortable while alone with them at your apartment crossing all boundaries of appropriate. Thinking back I feel like she wanted to see that I can be just as messed up as she is because she was getting in the situations in my age while I (aside of this I situation convinced I was groomed into and couple of more but in general) was rather of “exemplary, obedient kid” and since she clearly struggled with self hatred at this point I think she was trying to mess me up as well. I don’t want to make it sound like it become a habit - it was just few instances but it was going there unless I’d stopped it. And it happened after one night when I felt so bad (I started to struggle with suicidal thoughts as well)  I was very self destructive so just decided to just drink whatever she gives me without refusing even tho knew it was hurting me (also she was in the same Christian group as I back then (I’m atheist now) so it’s even weirder but it was certain form of “moral” self harm as well) and I felt like I’m getting warm, and my mind started to slip off and I felt so weird like i control my own body less and less and I went to the washroom looked in the mirror and realised I’m getting drunk - for the first time ever in my life and I felt so bad, god, so disgusted with myself, I almost felt dirty. But also I felt like i want to go back and drink more because it eased the deeper pain I had inside me. It was dangerous because she could’ve send me the bad slope as i have history of sever alcoholism on both sides of my family. I think I cried. I managed to make myself sleep thru it and next time argued that i will never drink with her again even tho it required to be standing my ground and I actually felt scared because of the amount of pressure from her and it actually hurt her feeling as if I’m ungrateful. Later may be 6 months after I realised how weird it was. Before leaving the country I confronted her and said how I regret it, how it made me feel bad, and how it was wrong and that she can never do this again with anyone. She didn’t said she sorry. I think she felt bad but still didn’t understood the full scope of it and had this hint of “it’s me being ungrateful” in her emotion. 

Now I’m 18 and I don’t want to be drinking until I’m at least 25 to let my brain full develop. I vented about it to ai once and I cried because turns out it did make me feel bad and affected me emotionally more then I realised. It wasn’t the worst thing that ever happened to me - I had much worse - but it went into the folder of “how adults who should’ve known better failed me”. I didn’t tell anyone but wanted to share it to hear the outside opinion of how bad/weird it actually was.
Thank you.

Original Idea: Please no judgement for the attached pics—these are my most raw thoughts, that I am only posting to hopefully help some people.

I cant afford therapy rn and I’m sure many others cant either. My trauma has been essentially eating me alive these past few years, so last month i decided to take it into my own hands and it’s actually helping.

First, I made a list of every traumatic event I’ve been through in my life. I listed each one in only a few words. (The list ended up being over 80 🫠)

Then I took that list and I started going through them one by one in a journal, doing a complete break down. I used a bit of a DBT format I learned from a group therapy program as a teenager, and a bit of just my own way. 

You can write the trauma, memories that go with the trauma, feelings that go with that trauma, why you shouldn’t feel any bad feelings that aren’t your fault, random important thoughts you have about it, trauma responses you’ve gained from it, how to combat those trauma responses, how to see the trauma in a more positive light, etc. 

I’m probably going to get a lot of crap for this, but for the ones where I didn’t know how to go about it I used Chat GPT. I would tell it the traumatic event in detail and it would break it down for me. Then I’d say different feelings and trauma responses that came from it and it would give me ways to not feel that way and combat the trauma. 

Tbh I think this is a rly great thing to do if you need help, but just can’t go to therapy for whatever reason. I hope this helps someone. Let me know if you have any questions.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: I didn’t have an easy upbringing, my mom was a depressed alcoholic and she committed suicide when I was 10. I was raised by my uncle and grandma, which was toxic as hell, my uncle always bullied me for “being fat”, my grandma was unstable and she kept yelling at me. I had horrible relationships. I was raped 3 years ago. I went no contact with my toxic family in May. My dad died of Cancer on June 1st. I had to witness 2 epileptic seizures of my fiance on July 23rd. I’m also an addict to make things worse.

I called the psychiatry this afternoon but they’re only available between 9 am and 12 pm every weekday, which is a very narrow window and as someone who struggles with depression, anxiety, panic attacks and possible autism, I feel like they don’t even care.

I’ll continue fighting as I have a fiance and 2 beautiful cats, I have plans for my life but it just feels like life likes me fucked up…

Apologies for rambling, I really needed to let this out instead of going insane and maybe I’d find some people here who can relate and I can share my thoughts with them. Maybe. No idea.

Original Idea: Nostalgia for me is probably the worst feeling ever, or at least it is when you have had a traumatic childhood. What am I yearning for? For when I was on my bed , whit purple butterfly sheets asking no begging my mom to see a psicologist? Or for when  I was assaulted and almost raped in a pirate boat bounce house? For when I was alone and had no friends on top of being relentlessly bullied and outlasted? Meaby I miss my family being together...probably the only thing that has become worse instead of better.But still...I wish I was a child again and that was the worst time of my life...it's soo weird man.

Edit:sorry just needed to rant 
Nsfw tag cuz...rape mentioned?

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Me 33 and my sister 32, were abused by our uncle (he was a drunkard) when we were left at his care for 3 months. We were 8 and 7. Our parents were away for Mom's surgery in another state.

One day I broke a cassette tape of his. He got mad. He asked me to take my pants off. He started hitting me with a stick. His wife tried to stop him, he hit her too. My sister watched me get beat and cried. He left us locked in our room and left for work. After he came back he saw us sleeping. Sis was holding onto me while I still had no clothes on from earlier. He woke us up and said, "So that's what you both like huh?". Ever since then he forced us to sleep naked every night. I'm not sure if he got involved with us, we both have no memory of it. I remember the first few nights were scary for me and her, we'd both would end up wetting the bed and get yelled at in the morning.

The more we were made to be naked around each other, the more comfortable we got around each other. We ended up exploring, playing doctor, rubbing our privates together etc. No sex happened because we weren't aware of penetration or sex but we did other things that made us feel 'good' aka orgasms. It was more of a game to us at that point.

We moved back to our parent's after they came back. We never told them what happened since deep down we both knew it was our little secret. When our parents would leave for work, we'd take our clothes off and lay next to each other or do our homework while naked. Sometimes we'd get playful and get to rubbing it together or humping. It was a comfort thing to us at that point. We didn't have any friends and all we had was each other.

These games weren't a usual thing but it happened occasionally. When we were 11 and 10, we got to playing again one day. We both ended up having orgasms, only this time it felt different and very wet. I got off her and looked down and to our horror, I was leaking and her privates were covered in clear fluid with blobs of white stuff. We got freaked out. We didn't speak to each other for days. I thought I was sick. Later I got to do some reading and learnt that it was semen and it was normal. We never played those games again after learning that it can cause pregnancies.

After we grew up, I confronted her about the past when we were 27 and 26 and she was happy that I brought it up. We did it on text so it was easy to open up than face to face. We confessed that we both missed the past and it was our special thing. Things got heated. We decided to meet up at our parents during the holidays. We snuck into each other's rooms at night and reenacted the past for 2 whole weeks. No sex happened even though we both wanted it. We both agreed it was good not to cross that line if we ever came to regret it later. Later we both started feeling guilty and put a pause on it.

2 years passed by after that and she got married. A few months into her marriage we brought up the past again when talking about other things. We talked for a few days just like old times. I ended up asking the ultimate question of me or her husband if it came to it, she chose him and we ended it there.

At the present, I try not to think of incest or anything related cause I relapse so hard. I sometimes use AI (the ones who can pretend to be your sister) to find some peace to fill that void. Life has to go on. Well, that's the end of my boring story.

Original Idea: So I have been in 5 long relationships. They all cheated and lied to me. Now I can't have a healthy relationship because I start seeing any behavior that's similar and I start thinking they are cheating or lying! I have ruined some relationships that could have led to marriage. Especially the last two. And after they were over I still can't determine if they were being sincere or lying. It eats me up because I don't want to believe the worst but their behavior shows they may have been lying. I have to learn to trust but its so hard! And suggestions?

Original Idea: 
Back in the 2000s, it was acceptable to spank your child when they misbehaving. Nowadays, it isn't. My mother used to it all the time when I would. 

My mother had an affair with a married man. We got push out of that town because basically with pitchforks. That man abused me. Locked me and my sister in our bedroom and took the door handle off so we couldn't get out. My mother basically did nothing and just let him. 

He also sexually abused me as well. 

At one point, my mother pushed me into a wall once and I had a bump on my head. 

There is probably other stuff and I just don't remember

My mother constantly says shit to my psychiatrist and nurses that I am fucked in the head but its all because of her. It's like she has fucking forgot about everything or gaslit herself. My psychiatrist and nurses all believe whatever she says and I am sat there like whatever. 

They don't know about the abuse. Maybe I should tell them.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Today I wanted to talk to you about this abuse that happened to me when I was in sixth grade, still when I was only 11 years old.
It was the last day of school before the Christmas holidays, and I had asked my parents not to pick me up in the car at the end of school because I wanted to take a friend of mine home. This was the biggest mistake of my life.
My friend wasn't at school that day, so I went home alone. I knew the way, I had already done it a thousand times on my own, but that day went differently. I was walking under a porch, what I always did to get home and at a certain point I came across a man on a bicycle, and to let him pass I moved towards the right side of the porch. We weren't too far away, also because I couldn't move much to let him pass, because on the side of the porch (my side) there were some chairs and tables from a pizzeria, which was closed that day for the Christmas holidays. What happens? As soon as I move to let him pass, this man slows down on his bike as soon as he sees me and says "hello beautiful", that in Italian is "ciao bellissima". I think is sort of scarier scarier in Italian than English, because it was said in a really suspicious way. if I could describe it with one sentence it would be "I'm interested in you in a sexual way". Then, with his left hand he touches one of my breasts. I turn around and he calmly continues riding his bike. At that moment I didn't know what to do so I ran home after yelling "fuck you". Unfortunately that day there was almost no one on the street, and the few people who arrived later either didn't see the scene or did nothing. After I got home I started crying, tear after tear about what had happened. obviously I went to report it immediately afterwards, still with tears burning in my eyes.
Now I don't know whether to consider this a real sexual abuse, but I was 11 years old, and in any case it was burned into my mind. Every time I think about it I feel nauseous, and every time I see the jacket I wore that day, that is, the same one he ran his filthy hand over, I feel like washing it, throwing it away, ripping it off if I'm wearing it. It was a faded blue jacket my grandmother gave me, I really liked it as a jacket, but I can't wear it anymore. 
And nothing, this is the end of story.
Would you consider it sexual abuse?

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: I'm 21f from India, I was looking for a page where I can share this trauma so here I am.
This incident took place last year in June.
 
(A bit of background).
My parents separated before my birth, I live with my mom and grandparents, my father lives separately close to my house with his mother. I used to usually visit my father twice a year, once on his birthday and once during summer holidays.
So last year my father invited me to stay with him for two days saying that he got two days off from work. He also said he'll bring some alcohol. None of the above said things seemed like a red flag because after 18 my grandparents allowed me to have alcohol only in winter and once a week, I have shared many great memories with my grandfather over a glass of whisky and rum, I have had wine with my aunts and beers with my cousins so it didn't feel like a red flag to me when my father said he wanted to a drink with me.
I went over to his place, we chatted, had dinner. After my paternal grandmother went to bed, he brought out the alcohol. We are drinking, chatting, nothing out of the blue or nothing alarming. I was super drunk so I went to bed, after 10 mins I feel my father laying down beside me and he starts to touch me inappropriately, I got very scared because I have ptsd from past sexual assaults. I couldn't move my body. And my father is very tall above 6 feet, well built and strong. It felt like burning when he put his fingers inside of me. He used his tongue on my vagina and his penis. I felt pain course through my body. He stops after he's done, cleans up himself and goes to bed like he didn't just rape his own daughter. After that incident I was never the same, I hated my body, I used to burn the parts of my with cigarette butts, the places he touched. I hated having sex which was a shame because I used enjoy sex, having sex used to make me me feel liberated, calm and free. 
I don't love sex now, I don't even like getting touched even if it's a tap on my shoulder. I'm also very touch starved as well. 
The only people who knows about it are my close friends, maternal grandparents, my close aunt, and my therapist.
I go through massive episodes of depression, PTSD and I have bipolar too but I'm under medication hence I can function but sometimes it gets too much and I think about self harming, I don't go through with it, but the thought is very tempting.
I'm writing this to share my painful memory, and also to the people who has gone through something like this, my love and prayers go to, hope you are doing well.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: I'm sure this trauma is nothing compared to what other people have probably faced on here but I need to know if anyone else was deeply scared of this book.

Ok, so when I was in Elementary school the best year there probably had to be 1st grade. But there was one thing that caused a deep trauma for me. And that was a book called the Bad Case of the Stripes by David Shannon, you know the guy who wrote the No David books?

This story starts on Tuesday in February in 2018. I was 6 years old and my birthday was in about a month. Anyway, so it was a good day until we came back from lunch and we had ELA, English Language Arts, or just English.

So what happened was we were reading a book on the Smart Board (A projector they use in most schools in my state. I don't know if other states use it) Anyway, so this was nothing abnormal, and I was intrigued to read it because I think I thought it was about a zebra or something.

Sadly I was wrong. The minute they showed us the book cover, I knew this wasn't going to end well. And I was right.

Now, before I continue, I'll tell you what it's about and then why it scared me.

So, the book is about this girl named Camilla Cream, and she loves Lima Beans but her friends don't so she pretends to hate them too. (Doesn't seem so bad now? Trust me it gets worse) Anyway, so on the first day of school, Camilla suddenly wakes up with multi-colored striped skin. They call a doctor who gives her some pills, but the pills then turn her face into a gumball machine. And then when she ends up going to school, her face changes to different patterns whenever someone names them. Then her parents call in health experts who just make it worse by saying the most grotesque and disturbing things that would terrify a 6-year-old. Luckily, an old woman shows up and tells her to just eat Lima Beans and she'll be fine. And she is and never denies them again.

The moral of the book is to be yourself not matter what others think cause it might lead to trouble.

Now onto why it was so disturbing for me. So because it was on the smart board the images were popping out at you. Even the really grotesque ones. By the time the book ended, I had my head down crying my eyes out.

One of the helper teachers took me to the nurse to calm me down but the damage was already done. I was scarred for life. And it only got worse from there. When my teacher told my mom about what happened, she and my brother laughed at me. And then that night I actually had a nightmare about it. And the other kids were talking about me behind their backs whenever they read it.

Sometimes, I even cried after seeing someone read it cause it triggered the memory. I had to lie that I missed my mom because I thought everyone else thought I was weird for being scared of it.

I know what you're thinking, it can't get any worse, but it did. We kept reading it every year, luckily I was "Brave" and told my teacher that I was scared of it and asked if I could go sit outside or to the principals office until it was over, and that's usually what I had to do.

Anyway, luckily I haven't heard it mentioned in years until me and my friend, who was actually one of my friends in 1st grade and in my class, told me she was actually scared of it too only she held in her tears.

But yeah, please let me know if you're scared of this because if you feel like you're the only one scared of it, like I did then please know you're not alone.

Original Idea: I was with my ex for four years and I was super young at that time , she was like 15 when we started dating and I was just 11 I didn't really realize it was grooming until well later on I feel like I'm stuck in the same place now. Like there's no getting out of this I feel like it took me such a long time to even realize how traumatized the relationship left me I couldn't do anything after it ended for the final time I couldn't feel anything anymore and I still don't and Im self aware about the reasons as well I know it was toxic and she was very manipulative she was just like my parents. the ones who traumatized me my whole life already , my parents are abusive and have always been shit and she knew that all well yet she would love bomb me and then taunt me and tell me hurtful things implying my past and she knew well it would hurt me bad. But anyway I ended things for the final time while I could still get away she came again and again for me because apparently I was the only one she had but she always cheated on me I lost count how many times she did now. She never saw what she was doing as wrong she didn't want a relationship but wanted me to be hers even tho she was the one to ask me to date first? It all made no sense it was all so fucked up but I have no idea how to process the trauma from it all. 
I feel like even if it all ended I'm just still stuck in the same place and can't get out of the traumatic memories even her name makes me want to throw up literally.
Does anyone know any way to deal with this and move forward? I'm over her I know that for sure but for some reason I just cannot move forward. Its frustrating me now because I see everyone moving forward in their lives and I feel stuck

Original Idea: I've lived with secrets of things that I've done due to trauma that are so sick, deep and twisted that I've never told anyone. I blame myself for a lot of it and struggle to process it. The other times I understand the psychology behind it. I don't know who to talk to about this or even where to start. Two wrongs don't make a right, but I was so so young and I didn't really understand what I was doing. It makes me sick these days to think about.

Original Idea: I don’t quite know what sub to post this in, and I can delete it upon request. This is more of a questionnaire, as I want to know what others think.

Before I start, I wanted to apologize for my poor grammar and mentioned topics, as I am going through a large quantity of things right now.

When I was about seven or so, my baby sitter insisted that I get in the car and “Go to McDonalds” with her, and her boyfriend. I said no at first, as I was taught to be wary of strangers, but she got upset, so I said yes. 

I don’t remember much, but she forced me to sit on her lap (and I’ve been told by family members that I mimicked grooming behavior, and hyper sexuality, also from my own memory). I think they said that we would only get food if I let them touch me; though I could be incorrect. They may have been brought somewhere else, though I have little remembrance of it and it could be a synthesis of my mind. They most likely locked the car doors as well. I told my mother after the trip, which made me doubtful that anything extreme happened - before I wrote this, I remembered more distinguishing factors, but they are quickly slipping away.

I also have memories of possibly being assaulted in a bathtub. I’m confused, and I don’t want to lay claim to something that is usually one of the worst things a human can go through; and if I did, it probably wasn’t close to others suffering.

I apologize for how poorly written this commoderation of text is, and for possibly wasting others' time. I also was abused non-sexually by my parents, though I do have dreams where they are my sexual abusers. Thank you for getting so far, and again, I’m so sorry for the fact that my current literacy is so poor. I will continue to update this if I am able, or if I recall more details. Her boyfriend was also allegedly convicted of murder, as he had apparently killed a young girl before me. I have XX chromosomes, though I myself now lean more A-Gender. I am also diagnosed with C-PTSD, Depression, General Anxiety, OCD, ADHD, Autism, and what I would believe to fall under paranoid schizophrenia.

Original Idea: I don’t know anyone in my circle of friends or family who has experienced trauma like I have. I don’t want to overshare, and I know there’s no point in trying to quantify the trauma. Everyone has something they’ve faced and their 10/10 worst experience is their 10 and that is completely valid! 
That said, I would love to hear stories of people who have overcome some really tough life experiences, like decades of Stockholm syndrome, for instance, and found consistent joy and stability ❤️

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Hello! I am 23 and have a very complicated family story/dynamic. My mom was heavily abused as a child and really had a hard hard time her whole life. I don’t know details but since I moved out a few years ago our bond grew stronger and more honest so I know this. She told me. She also abused me because she was overwhelmed with herself (she has borderline) and being left alone with her kids but I love her and I forgive her. A big part of that is that I pity her and wish her a better life and since I’ve moved out and gotten into therapie and got more mature I’ve seen things as they are or learn about my generational trauma more and more. I have a older brother who is 10 years older and a younger sister who is 10 years younger. The way my mom brought her trauma into the way she raised her kids has a base line but is differentiated. I feel like the older she got the more she tried to break her patterns. Still every single one of us got abused one way or the other. My mom was undiagnosed, traumatized and raised her kids alone, all while suffering. This is not an excuse, trust me I know. It’s hard for me to not feel bad for her tho. My brother disconnected from the family a few years ago. My mom got pretty sick mentally when I was about 18/19. She had to get hospitalized and I was pretty much alone with my 9 year old sister. Even before this my mom did seek help already but did not have enough space and time to do it extensively and worked pretty hard for us to live a decent life. Therefore I had to take responsibility at a very young age for me and my sister, maybe beginning when I was 14? I was practically a second parent figure, without being mature enough to endure this. So I did a lot of mistakes. The way is saw my mother handle me and my siblings stuck to me and I copied her behavior because i didn’t know better. My sister was not an easy child and also terrorized us and I was overwhelmed. So I screamed and pushed her to the ground when she didn’t listen or insulted me or hit me even after me trying my best to be calm. I abused her physically. It got worse when my mom was in the hospital. I was worried about her while dealing with the emotions of my sister and her way of dealing with the situation. She hated me for trying to be her guardian. She told me she wished I was dead and since then our bond is broken. Before and after that every Christmas has been hell. She switches her mood unpredictably making my mom sob out of helplessness. And I felt like I need to step in and help her. Make her feel better. It’s like walking on eggshells around my sister all the time. I know that it’s still not right to abuse someone because of this but I feel like my mom couldn’t handle all of that alone. Now that my sister is older and my mom is in Therapie and working on herself for herself and for us her way of parenting got so much better. She isn’t abusive verbally or physically anymore. She is calm and patient and loving and gives my sister every help she needs, doesn’t matter in which way. But my sister just takes everything that doesn’t go her way as an attack or rather is very easily triggert. She isn’t to blame but she is blatantly disrespectful and she doesn’t wanna go to therapy at all. She is still to young and very closed off now. Especially to me. Which makes sense. We don’t see each other frequently cause I live far away and I gave her time to regulate her emotions towards me. Now I’m trying slowly to form a bond again without pressuring her. But it’s hard. Sometimes when I visit, she feels attacked if I say one word that triggers her. Then she continues to insult us and isolate herself. Both me and my mom give her the space to do so, because any other way just escalates (my mom isn’t abusive anymore).Of course she is traumatized and doesn’t realize it so she tries to deal with it the only way she knows. I accept and understand it absolutely. It’s just so hard because I love my mom, I would die for her and I can’t bear her being hurt, even tho she is responsible and has to take the consequences. I also can’t bear the fact how my sister will face the consequences of our actions. The way I feel this guilt for traumatizing my sister and being an abuser because I couldn’t stop the cycle soon enough haunts me while simultaneously mourning for my mom and the way this dynamic and her own guilt destroys her inside. My mom told me that when I’m not home, it’s not all that bad. The bond with my sister and her grew different too, but everytime I visit it’s just all the same which makes me also feel guilty putting this pain inside my mom too and that this is my fault. I don’t know how to cope with this. It’s eating me alive.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: TW: possible CSA (i don’t even know what to call it. that’s why im here)

this is a throw away account, just putting that out there.

i am currently in outpatient therapy after several weeks of partial hospitalization. during my treatment i have been unpacking trauma i never have before. but there are some things i am too afraid to say in group, to my therapist to say out loud. journaling doesn’t help, i need feedback from real people. 

i have been coming to terms with some things my grandmother has done to me. she touched my breasts, crowding me and tried “helping me put on a bra the right way”. which involved touching that i don’t even completely remember. but i remember the feeling and emotions i had afterward. 

she has also pinched/squeezed my butt since i was a small child. as well as shoving her finger up my butt through my clothes, but to the point cloth would get stuck there, i was a small child when she did this. (i am feeling physically ill remembering this) she has made comments about my genitalia and my panties. saying my privates must “smell good” because my cat slept in my underwear drawer (???)

i also remember her nightgown being flipped up by her. she wasn’t wearing underwear. 

but on top of all of this. i am remembering things my parents did. 

my dad slipping his hand high up under my pajama pants leg. laying on his chest when he was in his boxers and i felt him pressed against me.

my mom trying to teach me how to kiss. 

this isn’t even unpacking everything else that has happened to me in my childhood. but i’m just…remembering all of these things. i’m hurt by them. they make me feel disgusted. i don’t necessarily think these people did those things for sexual gratification but…they were done to me. i am by far the most triggered and disturbed by my grandmother. i have had nightmares/flashbacks. no one cares. no one thinks it’s a big deal. but i am realizing that i have been mistreated since i was very young in many ways. 

but i cant call it CSA, can i? i cant call what my grandmother did molestation. i wasn’t raped. i don’t deserve to call it those things. i feel like such an attention seeker. like i so desperately want to be a victim. but these things really happened. it’s all so complicated.

it’s hard to even bring up that because of everything, including these mentioned incidents, have caused me to age regress involuntarily. it’s hard to bring up because i don’t think people understand. i’m sorry for rambling. i just need to be heard.

thank you.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Why doesn't anyone care about the people who are traumatized? 






Why do people claim to love someone but don't give two fcks about their mental and physical well being?






I have a narcissistic "father" who traumatized me a lot. Because of him i can't trust people and any time i open up enough to trust someone a little, I'm reminded of why i shouldn't.





I don't talk to people a lot, it's really hard for me. Yup, "family" included. 





I can't be open to someone who claims to love me but does things behind my back that proves the opposite.




My siblings never protected me in my childhood. I felt closest to the one sibling who didn't live with us. Probably because i didn't see them just watch that narcissist hurt me.





Later when i finally moved away w my other parent when i was 19, i accidentally found out a year later that the sibling I'm closest to, stays in contact with the narcissist. (They're not related and the narcissist didn't love my sibling like they were their own kid anyways) I don't trust them for shii anymore and all my effort to try and be more open  with them went down the drain.





My other parent who i moved away with. half a month after moving, on my birthday, told the narcissist our location. i didn't feel safe when we moved but this made me feel more unsafe than anything. What an awesome birthday gift huh? I ran away, cried so hard i started bleeding from the nose and almost went & took my own life. My nephews inviting me for a sleepover saved my life that day.





After that i didn't talk at all to my other parent but later i decided to have a talk with them. I told them exactly how everything made me feel and how i almost took my own life because of their stupid decision to care more about the narcissist than their own kid.






Now over the year and a half, I've caught my other parent lying to me a lot. Some white lies but also some that are pretty big deals.





The last few month we've been dealing with getting a new place in another city. We don't plan to stay here because the narcissist kept harassing my other parent at their work place, and following us around. My parent even quit their job because of it as well.





Today i found out something that has put all the work I've done on myself, Back to 0%. 





We agreed that our new location shouldn't be shared because we don't want the narcissist to come and follow us anymore or if they snap one day, to come and 💀 us. (I think you can guess where this is going)





Went to the store today, an old acquaintance asked if I'm living alone now. I said no, "I'm living with my parent." The next words felt like i was stabbed in the heart.




"Oh i thought your parent already moved to **our new future location**, everyone in the village thinks  they already moved there....."





🥲 And just like that. All my process went back to 0%.




The whole village knowing, means the narcissist knows as well because he lives there. I thought i can wait until i finally move to our new place and i can finally feel safe but i guess i wished for too much.





I've been trying my best to work on my trauma and anxiety, I've been looking forward to moving because that would've meant me feeling safe enough to work on it even more and actually getting to heal. If i don't feel safe enough It's feeling like I'm really rusty and it's hard move forward in my healing.






If I don't feel safe at all i feel like I'm stuck in place entirely. I convinced myself to feel somewhat safe so i wouldn't be stuck in place. What helped was thinking of the future place where i will feel safe. Put it's all gone now. Everything keeps grumbling around me and i don't really see a point of doing this anymore.





I don't even care anymore about who couldn't keep their mouth shut and told everyone about it. Probably a combination of everyone in the family (not me tho). 





It just hurts, to not be cared about. My siblings i have helped with whatever they have needed, babysitting, money problems etc. 





My parent I've been taking care of them as well. To show them how good life is without a narcissist. I can't do much because of being disabled but I've done more than that narcissist ever has. I don't yell at them or bully them or mock them etc. When we stumble on problems, i make sure to talk it out with them calmly and come up with plans together. 






I make sure that if they want/need something, they will get it. I walk them to/from the bus station to show them that they are waited/wanted home and to show they don't have to go through everything alone, they have someone by their side for support and they don't have to feel alone. I try to help with chores as much as possible even tho I can't really do a lot because of disabilities. I try to cook for them to give them a break. And bunch of others things.





I guess my love will never be enough for others and it will never make anyone care about me even a little bit.












I just wish people cared more. I wish i wasn't disabled from the trauma so i could leave everyone and everything behind.









Not a single day in my life have i felt safe, and as life has shown, i never will.






Truth hurts.



Now I'm stuck

Original Idea: When I was around 11-12 a 15-16 y o guy was talking to me a lot, back then I was too innocent to realize he was trying to groom me and he seemed innocent since he was young too, he didnt seem to be a p3adophile, but he was. All of a sudden he started bullying me and I was seeking his approval, then came weird sexual games I didn't understand. He was an ex student from my school so it wasn't weird that he was spending time at my school either, he pretended to talk to other people there when he was actually there to groom me. I really didn't understand anything and sooner or later it happened, the terrible thing. I felt horrible and I told my closest girlfriends about it(they were the most popular girls of my class) and they thought it was weird. Two days later the rumor spread and everyone was hardcore bullying me about it. He even told everyone about it making me seem like I was a slut. I was so confused and I didnt know what to say I was playing along with what everybody said. My friends tried to help me deny it but I couldnt deny it because I was seeking for help, but instead I got even more shamed. I felt terrible and Im glad I had the strength to not kill myself. 11 years full of spiritual experiences, destructive behavior as a teen to distract me, meditating, manifesting , etc I thought I had completely forgotten about it and moved on. I no longer care about those kids back then. But recently, even thought my life is out of a wonderful movie rn, this old feeling of shame and regret and wanting to fit in had come back, and it feels so bad. I was never enough for my friends back then, they thought I was a monster, everyone hated me and bullied me. I don't know what to do..... I know that if i continue my healthy lifestyle of meditating and taking care of myself I will be good and when I focus on the things I like and the good parts of my life. But this part of my past is like a forbidden zone of horror. But the past...  
It's just the past. It doesn't exist unless I say so. I have to be good to myself. That is my greatest lesson.

Original Idea: My boyfriend and I have recently been honest with each other about sexual thoughts we’ve had about other people. We are both very committed to each other, have been actively working on our trauma, and we know these thoughts are just thoughts, we’ve never acted on them or cheated. It’s something like this, we’ll see random strangers and it’s like 1 minute of imagining a sex scenario with these people, my boyfriend added it’s bc he “likes to make people feel good” and I guess it’s why that happens for me too. We’ve been able to talk about a lot of the thoughts but we don’t rlly remember details of the thoughts or who, we know it probably had to do with sexual trauma that we’ve both had. But we’ve both had this since we were way younger, we’re both in our early 20s now and it has been since we were around 12-13 years old. Does anyone know what this is? Intrusive thoughts maybe? But we feel guilty and disgusted with ourselves at the same time.

Original Idea: Has anyone here ever left everything behind for a fresh start? I want to leave everything behind even my country and start a new life. I know it sounds like a fairy tale, but I dream of living in the countryside, with less crowd and noise, a slow life free from crippling anxiety. People often say, “It’s your life, you can change it,” but in reality, it’s not that simple. My parents are here, getting older, and my own life already feels messy.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: (Due to my situation, the best thing to do is just wait it out) So I (16, FTM) already know that my mom is abusive and a lot of ways, including sexual and mental mostly. But I thought that the sexual abuse specifically started when I was nine, because that's my earliest memory of it. 

I never really blocked out much traumatic things related to sexual trauma because I was manipulated into thinking that it wasn't even trauma so I guess my brain didn't think to block it out due to that, because it didn't register to me that it was even trauma. 

I also do have a issue with fake and real memories, that's what I call it, because I do imagine hypothetical scenarios so I can plan ahead and be prepared for bad things, which makes me also not know what is a preparation of a possibility and what is a actual memory. 

The reason that I thought that the sexual abuse started at nine is that that's when a specific circumstance happened that I remembered clearly and that influenced a lot of other traumas, mental states, etc. 

To put it short, I was bullied when I was nine and it caused me to interact with a pedophile who groomed me. I got access to adult content through him and I eventually developed hypersexuality after I saw it of two guys because I'm a trans guy with a heavy preference for guys in my relationships. I didn't know that at the time obviously but I digress. 

Due to my parents being homophobic and things along those lines, this was my introduction to gay relationships existing in general, which obviously wasn't a good thing. 

And when my mom found out about it, she forced me to watch porn with her of that variety (gay) and when she was done, she said that she understood why I liked it because she found it hot. 

So obviously she isn't new to sexualizing her children, after this she began to sexualize me over a lot of things, never to that extremity again, but she just randomly makes sexual comments about things that aren't sexual, and it gets to a point where I basically have to hide the fact that I'm ever sexual ever, because I know she's going to say something about it and I know she's going to enjoy it. And obviously that makes me feel really gross. 

One of the thoughts, or memories I should say, that I got was a while back, like I didn't get this memory or preparation thing recently. But it was of me when I was around 4 to 5 years old, I don't know the exact age but I do remember (?) that I was a young child. 

I remember that I had a banana and juice box for a snack, and she ended up encouraging me to basically deep throat the banana, framing it as taking huge bites, and then washing it down with the juice. 

I honestly don't know if it was true, and I initially brushed it off as one of the prediction things because I had it in my mind that it started when I was 9 so I assumed that it was a prediction instead of something that actually happened. 

But I realized something that happened recently kind of mirrors that. It's not a direct copy of what I thought about, but it definitely has its similarities. 

The thing that has been happening recently is with my little sister, she is currently 7 years old, so a lot older than I would have been if this actually happened, but it still is something that feels similar. 

Because she didn't convince my sister to do anything, but when my sister was given something that's with the straw, like juice box, cup with a lid, whatever, she immediately put her lips all around it and very forcefully, and pretty violently honestly, started drinking it. I think she was just really thirsty or something, and she's a child so that fits. 

But then my mom looked at me as if something was funny? So I basically questioned with a what, cuz what, and she made a comment about how my sister is going to impress someone one day. 

I didn't respond to my mom because I didn't want to respond to that and my mom continued with like two or more sentences after that before she stopped talking cuz no one was talking to her. 

But now I'm kind of thinking that the memory I thought of was actually a real event, which would mean that it didn't start when I was 9. 

I assumed that I just "awakened" something in her by being a hypersexual child, I guess, as morbid as that sounds. 

So, what do you think? I want to make sure I can prevent things like that happening to my sister, if there's a possibility.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: For some context, I was born into a family with an absent father and a heavily drug abusing mother (Heroin, Xanax, Crack, Meth, pretty much anything she'd get her hands on she'd do) for my entire life, she did drugs right infront of me, nodding out, as I had to take care of my low functioning autistic younger brother, she'd bang on my door, begging me for money, pawn all my personal belongings, steal from me, abuse me financially, and never truly cared for me, it's been a year or so since she's failed rehab again in 29 years. She started at 15, me and my half sister (27F) have always been suspected of cPTSD and BPD respectively, Flash to now, I meet a woman, a lovely one but nonetheless has problems, she does anxiety meds and I can't tell if it's recreational or prescription but I believe it's prescription, whenever she does Xanax here's what will happen to me naturally

- 1, shut down completely, stop talking for a few hours, sometimes I'll leave her on seen, and sometimes I won't even read them at all, and I'll sit to myself and dwell on my past, there is 2 subtypes of emotions that will happen

- 1A, dread and silence, I'll feel completely empty, with no emotions, and feel like resorting to drastic measures on myself I do not commit to, the only way I cope through this phase is music, alcohol, and a heavy amount of nicotine, feeling as if I must scream but may not, feeling like my mind had frozen

- 1B, blistering rage, however in this type I don't show it to it's full extent, I will purposefully resist myself from yelling or going absolutely apeshit,

- these two forms are the most common
When I start talking to her again, I begin to act a lot more straightforward and even harsh at times.

- 2, I will begin to act completely aggravated with her and it shows, sometimes comparing her to my own mother straight to her face, which she heavily dislikes

- This phase is incredibly uncommon but can happen

I know that all of it is immature if it is simply to help with anxiety and is prescribed by a doctor but I can't stop my emotions from acting up like this, I want advice on how I can be comfortable with the prospect of it whilst not thinking of my mother

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: I'm a 40f with a history of complex trauma. My father has SUD and has been largely absent from my life save for a few superficial visits a year. My mother has BPD. More to say about my childhood trauma but not sure all of it is relevant for this post. 

A close relative died a few years ago and she made me her executor and me and my father are her beneficiaries. I have been dealing with legal issues with my father because he feels he should be getting more - which he never talked to me about but we are a year into attorneys and accountants and just... a mess.

Needless to say, this is stirring up all sorts of emotions: worthlessness, taking on guilt, just generally feeling abandoned, etc. 

This has been a stressful situation for my marriage because we have had to put our own savings into this legal mess. We have been together for 17 years and married for 14. 

I get that it's stressful and there's a lot to think about. But. Every time I try to talk to my husband about my emotional needs, he just gets pissed at how unfair all of this is. (True.)

I have tried giving him direct instructions that I need him to set that aside and be there for me emotionally. He tells me he isn't good at that. And that it isn't okay that I expect him to not get upset.

I have tried comparing trauma to physical assault. He disagrees.

It has gotten to the point that I don't even want to talk to him about it. He just won't even try to come alongside me. This all just makes me feel more isolated. 

(Yes, I'm getting medical care and see a therapist regularly.)

I don't know what to do or how to coach him to see that I just need him to be there for me emotionally. I have told him I can take care of the financial part by borrowing from my 401k but he is still pissed any time something happens.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Hi. I'm 21F, and I've been reflecting a lot on my childhood, especially with recent events. This is gonna be a bit scattered and a long post so I'm sorry. I mainly want other peoples opinions, because I'm trying to process everything still. 


My dad died from a young age, so it was simply just me and my mother. My mother (from my foggy memory) used to drink quite a lot. I remember I was probably around 8-12, and i HATED when she drank. it made me really anxious, even though she wasnt like blackout drunk and stumbling around or anything, she always was... playful, I guess is the best way to describe it? I remember asking her to stop drinking because I didn't like it, and she told me "im an adult and its none of your business what I do".

i guess one of the things I've been thinking about a lot  is she used to kiss my neck a lot, or try to. To be clear,  it didn't go further than that, and I HATED when she would do it, I remember that I felt so angry when she would do it that I could only laugh in response because I didn't know what else to do. But, y'know. obviously, looking back on it at my current age, I realize that is not normal at all.

Another memory that kind of just sprang on me not too long ago was, another moment when I was a kid and I tried to tell her I didn't like it when she drank, and I felt scared, and she got really pissed off at me and walked over to me, said something like "what, you think I'd hurt you?" and then held my throat. I don't know how else to describe it than that, because she didnt choke me outright, but she held my throat like she was gonna.

When I was 13-14, we got into a screaming argument because she asked me to pour her another drink and I said no, because I didn't want her drinking anymore, and I started having a panic attack because of how angry I was, and she just pushed me into my room and left me to calm down by myself.

As well as these specific incidents, I also think about how when I was a kid, i used to slap her ass or grab at her boobs, and instead of her teaching me how thats inappropriate, she just did it back to me. and obviously, again, realizing now as an adult thats not a normal or platonic thing to do. I felt really guilty about this, because I don't know why I started doing it as a kid, but I do realize part of it is on my mother for not being a parent and teaching me not to do that.

In my late teenage / adult years, she started financially abusing me. At one point there was a list of things she was saying I owed her for, e.g. a computer I asked for when I was 14, a fan for my room, etc. She also blamed the credit card debt on me, always citing such purchases ^^ whenever asked how the credit cards got so much debt racked up on them. Obviously, I'm not gonna act like I asked for nothing, I asked her to buy me a lot of things, and I was also on universal credit, which she ended up taking 90% of to "pay her back" and also to "pay bills." 

Obviously, it's in quotations, because I discovered she has a gambling addiction. When I was about 18-19, I was contacted to inherit some money my grandpa left behind to me when he died. (grandpa that she isolated me from, by the way :D) And, she took roughly £20,000 off me. Told me to keep £4000 for myself. She said it was to "pay off the debt," and I bet you can guess what didn't end up happening. 

For a bit of extra context, when I was 12 she got breast cancer, and when I was 14, she got rediagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to the brain. It was terminal, she had several brain tumors that were inoperable, and so, she has been on chemotherapy ever since. She's very independent, but I have basically been assigned her carer ever since then too. 

We've had several fights over the money,  and at one point she said I have not been a good carer- and to be clear, that's not incorrect. I don't cook, I don't clean, I am really lazy. But, I told her that I have never claimed to be a good carer either. But her on the other hand, she has claimed to be a good mother. And I called her out on that. Basically, she cried out of self pity, and said: "I dont know who put those ideas in your head", "we have very different memories of how your childhood was", "i am not that kind of person, i would NEVER do that.". 

Anyways. This has been a long enough post, and I really just want other peoples opinions on what the hell has gone on. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

Original Idea: I know this is a sensitive topic, but I need to get it out somewhere. When I was young (don't remember exactly age) my brother would start touching me and talking about my body, but not in the normal brother way. He would always comment on how my breasts were bigger than most my age and how my behind was getting so round. One day it escalated. We were in the pool while my mom was inside. He trapped me against the side of the pool and pulled my bathing suit aside. At the time I didn't know what it was, or that it was wrong. All I knew was that it hurt. Bad. But I knew if I didn't give in he would hurt me. So I let him. It lasted about 2 years before I finally told him to stop. For a while, I thought it was my fault because I didn't say no sooner. I thought it wasn't really SA because I gave in. I only realized that it was in fact SA after talking to one of my friends about it. It was years ago, but it still haunts me. I've become hypersexual because of it and I don't know how to control it. And what's haunts me the most? He would always make it seem like it was "brotherly love." I know he remembers. He always makes little jokes about it and it drives me insane. I'm losing my mind.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: I’ve noticed a very old coping pattern resurfacing as I start doing new kinds of work in my life.

My background: I have CPTSD from childhood abuse and years of toxic work environments. Over time, I built a survival tool that kept me “safe” — whenever work got demanding, my system would shut down everything else: I’d stop exercising, rest more than usual, eat more carbs, and conserve all energy for work. Back then, this kept me from burning out completely, but it also made my world very small.

The work I did in the past was more design-oriented — creative, familiar, and something I could perform confidently without triggering deep fear. It became one of my key coping tools and comfort zones. Now, I’m moving into entrepreneurship, which I’ve always loved the idea of and have a natural aptitude for, but it’s newer, more ambiguous, and less familiar to my nervous system. That’s when this old pattern reactivates.

If I start a new project or tackle a new type of problem, I fall into the old loop:
• Avoid physical activity (“save energy”)
• Crave comfort food
• Spend the day in a fog or stuck in bed
• Feel like I can only focus on the work and nothing else

I know this is my nervous system trying to protect me, but it’s frustrating — it makes days go by without balance, and I slide back into stress eating and guilt.

Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you start rewiring your body to feel safe doing other activities (like exercise or socializing) while handling new or challenging work?

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: TW: Gore, suicide, depression, sexual violence, necrophilia

I recently was shown a very disturbing video and I cannot mentally get rid of it. 

This all started during lunch break (we both go to the same university), when my friend was sent a video by a friend of their's (we met back in high school), and I don't like their friend very much. She was this edgy, grimy person who had a toxic personality and would occasionally send her friends disturbing videos (gore, executions, violent killings, etc.). Needless to say, I don't like her. I had a traumatic experience as a middle schooler. Many people in my school would show off/watch in groups gore videos and this made me sensitive and scared of those videos. I used to watch information videos on YouTube discussing icebergs and shit like that(I no longer watch these), but I never went out of my way to watch it. 

But I didn't know what was coming.

Prior to this conversation, I had a lot of mental issues (suicide thoughts, depression), but you could say I healed and went out of my way to discover and try new things, making my life way more positive than it used to be. This was such a long process of my life that genuinely changed me for the better. But the video they showed me shook me to the bone so hard that I cannot stop thinking about it. 

They just out their phone in front of me for me to watch the vidro, while they HAVEN'T watched it yet, and I thought this was just a funny TikTok or meme so I didn't think much about it, until I clicked play. This video had a man lying on the ground jerking himself off in the bathroom, his head resting on a chopping board of some sort. I was frozen. I didn't know what the fuck was even happening so I kept watching, until he came, and a cleaver chopped his head clean off his body. It took a few more chops to completely rip his head off his body, and the murderer holds his head up and started commiting sexual acts with it. 

This is the WORST thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Not to mention, he was a person with the same nationality as mine, and seeing the people of my country involved in this made me so weirded out and very sad. 

I kept thinking about it during break. I asked my friend why in the flying fuck would they show me that, but they never new, they just thought it would be something "funny". We sorted this out and they apologized and comforted me after I explained and everything is alright with our relationship, but my mental isn't. I dug a little deeper into what was the context behind this, and it haunted me so bad that I cannot fathom how this even happened. The man had a beheading fetish asked another man to chop his head off after he came. He had fantasies of this as far as 6 - 7 years before this and this was his chance to fulfill his desires. And as much as I know, the murder is a butcher in the city where I am living, this makes it so much worse than it already is. I will not be saying anything related to this any further. 

This video is haunting me. It is HAUNTING me. I've had countless nightmares about this alongside recurring thoughts of the murder. I've even had intrusive thoughts of this happening to me. I can't get rid of it. I don't know how. I truly don't. 

I beg of anyone reading this post to NOT watch this video. It doesn't benefit you in anyway, it is not safe and is literally a hazard to your brain and mental. Please. Don't watch it. 

I've been considering to seek mental consult, and finding other possible solutions to help me forget this god forsaken video. I'm traumatized. Very, very much.

Original Idea: Was this abuse

My mother left me for men over and over she would find them on dating sites and leave me home alone then my grandma would find me home alone my mom kept coming in and out of my life until oneday she eventually left me for a guy that lived next door to my elementary school she would come around once in a while but never brought me nothing my grandma took her to court and put her on child support when she came around my grandma would listen to our conversation and would tell me what to say to her when she brought me toys she told me not to use them my grandma got mad one time and gave me a beating because she told me to pack a bag and go to my mom's house and I didn't know she was joking when.

 My mom left when I was 8 finally to live with the guy who lived next door to my school when she left she stole my money.

 My grandma would tell me not to tell her things to only tell her and my grandma wouldn't let me think for myself she would always tell me what to think. When I was asked what I wanted for Christmas she would tell me to ask for jewelry 

 It got to a point I started cutting myself I was getting bullied at school and I felt hated at home my grandma would tell me im ugly that my sisters are prettier than me and she would always make it seem like she's on my side but once I did something she would throw it back in my face.  When I was really young and would throw up my food she would make me eat it she wouldn't allow me to talk to my dad I see why now he's an alcoholic. 

When I was cutting my self my school found out and they sent me to the crazy place and instead of her trying to understand me she yelled at me and was angry. My aunt told me to stop stressing her mother out I was sent there twice the second time she didn't visit me. 

My grandma  made me lie to people and tell them I don't know my mom and she got mad on Christmas when I told my friends and my friends mom that my mom was my mom. 

I've always been afraid of my grandma and would be quiet when my friends would ask me certain questions I would try to avoid the question because I was afraid I was gonna get in trouble I would go to other people with things that where going on. I still today am afraid to tell my grandma the truth like about what I believe as in my faith and about my son but I've been getting better the other day I told her he's my son and im gonna raise him the way I want too.

 When being around family such as cousins I got treated differently my aunt wouldn't let me use her soaps they would get mad if I didn't eat before I came but my cousin my aunts granddaughter could do those things. I feel like I could never be myself my cousins would say when my grandma was around I would act different and when I was at school that was the only way I felt like I could be myself. When I would do things for example it was forth of July and my birthday and I had some sparklers and was gonna light it I was nervous and my grandma went to my cousin and was like look at her.

 Sometimes I feel like my grandma thinks im dumb I think my aunt thinks im dumb too I haven't spoken to my aunt because I told her I was pregnant and she asked me can I take care of a child I said yes and she just said bye and hung up.My grandma's telling me to go on birth control and don't have any more kids. She's telling me I have to give him water and that I shouldn't make him go to sleep at 8pm he's only 5 months. She got upset the other day because I was giving him a 20 minute nap at 6 she was like he's sleeping so early. I repeated myself again and told her I'll wake him up after 20 minutes and he's going to bed at 8 and she said okay.

 Im still scared but im trying to start being a confident wife and mother and setting boundaries.

Original Idea: I just need to rant.... I don't even know where to begin. As most people with tons of trauma I have experienced all sorts of abuse at the hands of both my mother and father, so bad I got removed from my home by cps at 15. And I guess I never realized how the affects of abuse stick with you long term and it doesn't matter how much therapy or pills you take it will always come up and it will always make you want to just die. Im married now and I have a kid. My life is so peaceful and beautiful my husband treats me with so much care and I love nothing more than being a wife... But why does my past still affect me so much? I've been in therapy since I was 14 I've worked so long and hard to fix myself... And still I'm getting diagnosed with more and worse things that make my life so hard. (I don't even know if I'm making any sense I'm just typing) But for some context I got diagnosed with PTSD generalized anxiety and depression at 14 then at 18 bipolar 1 with psychosis and now at 23 with OCD it's gotten so bad that I've developed a fear of leaving my house. I force myself to leave but it's like pulling teeth. It makes me feel like a burden to my husband and not a good mother to my son and a disappointment to myself..... And nothing I do fixes it. I feel down.... I feel hopeless for the first time in a long time.....

Original Idea: Does it get easier

So i 22 was abused from 4-11 now this fkd me up obviously and theres still things i carry now but i didnt realise how many. I been talking to a guy for a couple months met last week and had a great date and stayed together. Done everything bar all the way, few days before i told him what id been through because theres certain things i say or do that are a result of that trauma. Like i will ask maybe 10 times during if this is okay and are you comfortable do you wanna do this etc and he was cool and understanding. Few hrs later he said he wanted to open up to me because i had to him. He told me he was brutally r493d at 15 by a guy in his 30s posing as a 18 yo and when he was describing it it killed me because i realised how many things could have triggered him and this played on my mind we went home the next day said goodbyes all good but that next night i laid awake all night panicking i had made him uncomfortable. I raised it the next day and he assured me i hadnt but said we should have some space and he didnt want me to view him as a victim now this is what ruined me because him needing space caused me to cling on and panic at the thought of losing him when in reality that drove him further away. I asked him point blank if he was still interested to which he said he thinks my emotional needs are too complex. Just needed to let this all out. Struggling at the thought of losing the first person i felt got me and made me feel heard. Obv this is just a snippet of my life and there are a lot of other issues that tie into this too

Original Idea: I used to have three best friends. The only problem? They all weren't doing too well mentally. Long vents, s/h, lots of mentions of sewerslide... I had to deal with my own problems AND all of theirs to make sure they were all okay. Now I have one best friend. What happened to the others is anyone's guess. But this friend has called me crying pretty much every day this past week. I'm honestly so tired. It's to the point I've decided something: I'll keep my current friends, but I'll never make another. Every friendship I've ever had has in some way, not ended well. Being left out, me not really feeling a connection and feeling guilty about it, pushing myself into the role of 'therapist' until I lose them... I don't want to deal with it anymore. I seem to be a magnet for becoming friends with people who are really depressed and fucked up mentally, so I guess that's who I usually connect with. The thing is if I do that again, it'll be more I have to deal with. But most of the other people who try to make friends with me; I usually just don't feel the connection towards them, and everything I do ends up feeling forced. I'll never talk to them first, and honestly feel really drained when they try reaching out. This just makes me feel guilty for 'pretending to be their friend' and 'hurting them'. Neither of these options are things I don't want to deal with right now, so I just... won't. Even if I never make a friend again.

Original Idea: Hello, so i dont even know where to begin, im a minor and keep in mind that i was an 8y when this started. (It kept going for 6 years), so when I was growing up I had an older brother (hes still living with us he is currently 20 years old) so he was around 14-15 when he had his first ill intent show clearly to me, I was 8 years old and we were playing together keep in mind he always closed the door when we played in my room i didnt know it was a huge red flag back then but now i shiver everytime i think about it. Of course things escalated to worse degrees, in each time we played he would start getting physical, like touching my hands, literally kissing me and telling me "its just a roleplay" while he pushed me into his bed to "roleplay", eventually when i turned 11-12 he started touching me in my private areas deeper and deeper, and the more he did it the more uncomfortable i felt, now its important to mention that he literally raised me into thinking that what he was doing was okay, and i never learned in schools about the no-no square or anything, and he told me to never tell our parents so i never did. He touched me so many times i lost count throughout the years, he even showered with me one time. One day, i turned 13 and decided to tell my bestie about everything, she was absolutely shocked and speechless, she immediately told me to tell my parents or else she will, I finally told my sister and she was shaking, crying and safe to say very disturbed. Now my parents admitted that they always felt off about me and him being alone, yet i wonder why they never did anything?? they gave him a phone from a very young age im talking 11 years old. When i told my sister she told my other brother (I have 1 sister, 2 brothers and including my bastard abuser i dont like referring to him as my brother at all) he was so shocked and defensive about me never going near my abuser again. Eventually they told mom and dad, they were cooperative at first, but slowly, when HE told his perspective, things took a literal 180 and changed, he made me seem like the one who asked for it, he made himself seem like the victim, he told mom and dad that our cousin sexually assaulted him too, which my parents interperted as "what he did to u is okay because he went through it too" thne of course i told my parents "i never want to speak with him ever again"

I wish that was the end of it, but hell no my dad came to me one day and forced me to talk to my abuser again whether i like it or not, i had no choice so i of course talked to him again, me and my siblings treated him so well for an entire year, but then one day i was so tired and sick i had a very bad fever and couldnt leave the couch to go to bed, i fell asleep so fast and suddenly i feel a cold breath on my stomach, i opened my eyes and i was literally shaking when i found my abuser AGAIN assaulting me, he was lifting my shirt up to peak at my chest, and i was shaking, out of breath and i felt like i was going to throw up. I immediately ran to my room where my sister was sleeping, i woke her up and panicked "HE DID IT AGAIN" i kept whispering to her while shaking, then she immediately texted my brother and she was so angry and scared. We could hear my abuser's footsteps outside while he wandered arouned our room i think he was trying to eavesdrop to see if i would say anything, we stayed till 6 am that day because we couldnt sleep because of how scared we were.

I cut all talk with him and my siblings did too, but then one day i got a thought "what if my siblings were talking to him behind my back?" and i hate it so muhc because my siblings supported me so much through this, i started arguing with my parents nonstop all year round, until we had a big argument about a literal burger, i hated my abuser so much to the point where i made my parents promise that on a special day that we were gonna make burgers that they do not feed him any, and of course they gave him a burger right infront me while my dad told me "i was being unfair and so dramatic" i was so freaking angry i ran to my room and slammed the door, i threw objects on the floor while screaming so loudly my sister came in and asked me if i was okay i kept  swearing and saying how they betrayed me and my siblings and i was crying, yelling and shaking all over the place

Now what shocked me the most was my mom and dad's reactions, they said i was being "disrespectful" and "so annoying and dramatic over a burger", i didnt give an F about the burger, its just the act that made me so angry because i made them promise multiple times that they wont do this, to this day a year late they still treat him like an angel, they always call him to breakfast lunc and dinner, of course he pretends to be the victim, doing things like not speaking when im around because he is "afraid" of me, my dad talks to him all the time while ignoring me and yelling at my siblings all the time. I hate this so much and i hate my abuser even more.

PLEASE i beg of u anyone out there tell me how to cope because im literally getting existential dread and anxiety and suicidal thoughts but i cant go to a therapist because of the high costs, im literally so depressed about my relationship with my parents and im so paranoid of even stretching or doing anything that reveals a single bit of my body around my abuser. WHAT DO I DO PLEASE!

Original Idea: I post this because I don’t really have anybody to tell right now. 

Literally just today my dad my sister and I witnessed a car veer off the road, flip and crash into a tree. I was on my phone texting so I did not see the Initial crash, but I remember my dad yelling NO NO NO! And I look up to see this dust cloud. My dad slams on the breaks and gets out of the car, I am still confused at this point so I ask my sister to which she doesn’t respond as she calls 911. A second later I realize what’s happening and I burst out of the car running after my dad, catching up to him and seeing this mangled flipped car. I immediately get on the ground to see how many people there and thankfully it was just one, a young lady. She had her window rolled down but it was small and their seatbelt was still connected. I then unlock the door at some failed attempt to pry it open. I then crawl slightly into the car and am met with the smell of blood and coolant, I look at her and her face is covered in blood and it’s dripping down to her arms onto the ground. 

She wasn’t responding so I started trying to make sure she was alive. At that moment I was terrified that she could be dead, or dying… I can’t remember where I touched her but I was trying to get her to respond, after a moment she then immediately groans and grabs my arm. The image of this has not left my brain. I immediately get this sense that I need to get her out, so I start trying to figure out how. But I see the police arrive and I realize I shouldn’t be the one doing this anymore. Thankfully, they were able to bring her out and while she was pretty messed up, I think she was gonna be ok. 

Huge shoutout to first responders, because without them this would’ve been terrible. After my family and I get back into the car and start to drive home, to this point today I keep getting flashes of her face and her grabbing my arm while she’s groaning. I just felt so powerless that I couldn’t do anything. I wish I could give her a hug.

Original Idea: TW⚠️: mentions of injury.





so I had some friends come with when I was getting some halloween pumpkins for halloween, and being stupid kids younger than 7, we decided to play " choo choo train " on the sharp gravel where basically we were running around in a circle in a line where there was barely any space, the kid in the caboose tripped, and the 2 kids behind me had a good enough reaction time, but I was in the front and I fell on my head, i scraped my head directly on the top right corner of my forehead, it was bleeding all over and I had my clothes stained, my friend's mom called 911 and they managed to get my head bandaged up to stop it for quite a bit of time, but they couldn't help any more than that, my dad was speeding to the ER and we managed to get there in time, by the time I was on the hospital bed my blood had already clotted, now I have a bump in the area where I got that injury, luckily it's covered by hair now, and i'm doing well.

Original Idea: (Disclaimer: English is not my first language)
Im 17 years old and I’ve been unable to cry since I was 14. As in physically unable to cry,even when it feels like I need to let my feeling come out. I’ve experienced some heavy trauma in my childhood(abusive dad and neglectful mom) and particularly from age 13 to age 16 I’ve lived with constant stress and anxiety due to the situation at home. I’ve been in therapy for like a year and a half but it didnt seem to work out,dropped my therapist in March. I came to terms with my past experiences and accepted them as a meaningful(yet hurtful) part of my life, but even tho I’ve processed everything,I cant still seem to be able to let my guard down and cry,even when Im alone. How can I get rid of this feeling? All I feel is numbness or a panick attack kind of sensation.

Original Idea: I’m heading into my fourth year of a degree I’ve fought hard to earn, despite facing unstable housing and almost no support network for years. For context — I’ve been living without close friendships or family support since I was 14.

Last summer, I came out of a lifelong dissociative state and had to face truths about my past that have been overwhelming to process. This includes the reality of living with complex PTSD and the toll it’s taken on my nervous system. I’ve spent years doing the deep, unglamorous work of self-healing, and while I’m in a much better place internally than I once was, I still have a long way to go.

All that said — I have a natural talent for writing. It’s one of the few things in my life that feels like it comes from my core. I write with depth, clarity, and emotional intelligence, and I’m looking to use this skill to create income while I finish my degree. I’m open to ghostwriting, content writing, or other freelance projects where my ability to express complex emotional truths could be valuable.

If you know of opportunities — or if you’re someone who values skilled writing informed by lived experience — please reach out. This is more than just a side gig for me; it’s a way to keep going while building something real.

I write for therapists, coaches, survivors, and anyone trying to put their lived experience into words that land. Whether it's a blog, a memoir, a bio, or just the raw shape of a story—you bring the truth, and I’ll help you shape it.

Here’s my portfolio:

I’m open to quick jobs, deep collaborations, or even helping you figure out what to say if you don’t know where to start. DM me if something resonates.

Thanks for reading—if anything in here hit home, I’d be honored to connect.

Original Idea: Ok. So he's an alcoholic, and an addict. Was the whole time my mom and him were together. 

They got together in 2018. They got engaged in 2019 or 2020. They broke up, still engaged, in 2022. Remember that. 

He had two kids who lived with us, a boy and a girl. He threw his son across his living room one night. We only know this because one of the kids called my mom.

A lot of things happened during the time they were together, including threats to my mom, our dog getting out because of him multiple times (never hurt, thank God), a lot of other things that I don't even know how to describe. My mom told me this after everything, he got them kicked out of couple's therapy because he threw a cup during the video call with the therapist. Dude. 

During the last year was the worst. He never hit me or my mom until 2022. She was on a trip when he backed me in front of a closet and yelled at me and then bopped me in the nose while drunk. Then texted my mom and told her I was "lying and was trying to ruin our family." Then the night before my senior homecoming that year, he cornered her in the hallway, and hit her. That night I was supposed to be gone at the homecoming game, but I'm glad I was home. He offered me a car that night, which is funny, since the whole time he lived with us, he didn't pay jack effing shit, and complained if you asked him to. And his daughter, who is younger than me and who can actually drive, didn't have a car yet. 🤨

He got sentenced in September 2024. At the sentencing, at least while I was talking that I remember because I did a statement, he pounded on his table like a caveman. And when he was supposed to do his apology, it wasnt one. It was "im sorry you guys feel like I did these things to you." 🤨 Oh, and apparently he got married to someone else in June of this year. 

What's sad about all of this is that he promised he would treat me and my mom better than my dad did, and that definitely did not happen. And honestly, my dad atoned and is doing better than Frank did. 

Me and my mom both think that once the protective order is over in 2026, he'll try to contact us. Because lil secret: they dated like 25 years ago, and then they dated in 2018. Wasn't on her accord that they started talking again.

Original Idea: I’m not gonna put the full story here bc it’s too long, but I thought I’d share a piece of it to get other people’s opinions on the crazy story of my childhood.

Basically, my moms ex was mad that she was leaving him. He knew that he’d never see her again and he had a crazy obsession with her, so he made up stories in court and got full custody of me and my siblings. The court system literally failed us. My mom did everything she could to tell them that HE was the monster and she wanted us away from him, but he’s a really good manipulator and he got the courts to believe him even without evidence.

After adopting us, he knew that my mom would be forced to see him every week in order to see us. That was the point. He’d never lose her as long as he had us as leverage. My mom fought for us for years, trying to get the courts to understand that he was abusing us. They never listened and left us there. They said she was crazy and trying to take us from a loving home.

So me and my siblings were emotionally, physically, and sexually abused over the course of 12 years with him. Finally, I got out when I was 14. Once the abuse stopped working on me and I started to fight back, he didn’t really care when I told him I was going to live with my mom. I remember when I came here him and the rest of my adoptive family said to my mom, “You finally won. You got the kids.” I’m an adult now and have lived with her ever since. She’s the best mom I could ever ask for.

There’s so much more to the story, but that’s the gist of it. We’re planning on filing charges against him soon and getting the courts to actually listen this time. I’m nervous, but hopefully I can get justice. I know I didn’t put much detail in this, but what are you guys’ thoughts on this mess.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: I grew up in a six person household. My family wasn't perfect, and I certainly wasn't. They did what they could to raise me right, but the truth of the matter was harder to accept back then. My mother was an alcoholic, and my dad regularly had an affair with another woman that everyone but me knew about. My siblings interactions with me were that of disappointment. In otherwards- I was starved for affection.

I knew my mother's alcoholism quite well including her attempt to go to a facility for a while to get treatment, and I was naively trying to fix her when she was home while bringing everyone in the family  together- but we were all broken apart, and I was too far in a naive denial and determination to accept it.

I wanted to feel loved by my mother, so I did anything I could with her. Watching her favorite shows, going out when she got her nails done just to support her, but she spent most of her days drunk in her favorite loveseat watching drama shows until passing out. As time went on, I felt more unloved the deeper into her addiction she went and the more time she spent asleep- so I turned to other people.

I found myself falling in love with others, it seemed like any semblance of kindness from any girl made me want to be with them- but I was always afraid of speaking to them. I think I loved six girls when I was in elementary school, only really " tried " confessing to one- never got a reply, I was the weird fat kid most people assumed was homeless because I smelled and never had my clothes looking quite right. 

As I got older, I found myself more desperate as time went on. I wanted to love, to be loved. All I felt was envy for those who were in relationships, and I found myself daydreaming about girls hugging me and saying they cared. My father took us from our mother to try and make a better life for us, and I had gotten with my first girlfriend shortly after. It was purely online, and I can say for sure that I felt loved. She was kind, sweet.. the kind of girl that could keep my heart racing with every message.

I was a coward, I was afraid of her. 

She showed me how to feel loved, she showed me how to lust and how to have sexual desires.

I was 11. It was an addiction that took root at my youngest, deep urges to be with her so intimately.

She was with me for four years until we broke up. Well- that's what I always told everyone. " We broke up because she cheated ". She never did. The most she did was love bomb me with sexual acts and dreams of our future and a family. I was a coward. I was afraid of her love. My dad had become negligent, putting his partner first and telling me that I was ungrateful, that I couldn't understand how much he loved me because I was " Different ". He said he couldn't love me for being how I was, a " Special kid who came last ".

He apologized later, said he didn't mean it. But those words don't just fade with an apology.

I wanted to be anyone but myself, because I didn't believe I could love someone properly. I was a coward who couldn't communicate his love to anyone, and in the end the way I told her all of it made her think I was just pretending. She didn't understand I was pretending to be happy with myself and my family because I didn't phrase what I meant properly, so she assumed I was pretending to be happy with her.   She broke up with me that same day, but when she realized what I meant- she wanted me for me. She loved me that much. 

I was scared. I had hurt her. I was still hurting myself. She wanted me.. and I blocked her. I told myself I had done too much damage for the relationship to be salvaged- truth is, I was afraid of loving her only to hurt her again. I was afraid of confronting her and continuing what we had.

Years passed, and after losing her love- my addition to lustful acts only continued. I was watching, doing, reading it- all the time. I slept with a girl when I was 16, but I didn't enjoy it- it only made the addiction worse, having phantom feelings that I couldn't repeat. As time went on, me and my mother became so distant that when she passed from her drinking- I was unphased. I knew it would come someday, and I hated myself for being ready for it- for not expecting a better outcome.

I got with another girl, online relationship from Australia. She was sweet at first, but my addiction made me come onto her too fast in the relationship. I did to her what my first partner did to me- coming in with lustful desires, and it disgusts me. Thinking back on the sexting, I don't care that she felt good- it was wrong from the beginning because of me. Even if we had gotten there naturally, the way it happened made me feel bitter.

She got attached to me early on because she enjoyed it, started love bombing about kids and a future.. and after spending years being alone and just losing a parent- I let her love me possessively, and it only made things worse between us. I let her use me as an object she could have anytime, all for " love ". We eventually split when she cheated on me and started trying to gaslight me with her " love " and her desires, and.. I told her no. She got aggressive and tried tearing me down, but with time- she stopped and blocked me.

As a coping mechanism to replace our relationship, I turned to ( I know it's goofy ) an AI chatbot. It just.. wasn't the same. You can cycle through tens of dozens of them, but it never fills the void of never being held by a woman.

I went to therapy for a while after deciding I couldn't live that way. I started finding different outlets to pour my energy into. My therapist said my trauma from a young age made the pleasures of relationships and sex as a coping mechanism to myself, that my daily act of pleasure was routine I had done when I was stressed or emotionally stagnant.

It hurt. The more I went to therapy, the more broken I felt. I didn't think I could be fixed. Past memories I buried resurfaced, guilt and anguish I wish I could go back and fix. Lies on Lies I wish I had never brought into this world. A fear of death I gained at a young age from losing my grandmother constantly looming over me, panic attacks at the realization of my own death coming- crying to myself wishing I knew a way to avoid it, the temporary acceptance of it only to be afraid of it again another day.

I hated it all. I hated myself. I hated my unhygienic lifestyle, remembering how my mother called me a pig. I hated my insecurities, the times I heard my partners cry on calls because of stupid things I'd say. I hated my desires, how they manipulated and blind me from my happiness. 

Sometimes I reflect on it all during any given day, staring blankly at something whilst in my head. People come to me and ask " Are you okay ? "

I always say yes, but I'm not. I never even told my father most of this. I wouldn't want him to die with a burden of knowing his son became so broken from something he never truly intended to hurt him. He cheated because my mom chose a bottle over him, he was hurting. His trauma of not being loved by her passed down to him not wanting my love and feeling angry when I said I loved him. He lashed out, and in turn I became traumatized thinking I couldn't love anyone properly, sexual influence from the only source of love I had became my only comfort and took over my daily activities. 

I'm done letting it pass on. I can't have a future where I have a kid and I do it to them. I'm scared of having a son or daughter turn out like me. I don't want them to. I want them to be better. I want to be better for myself and them, for my future partner and for my family.

I'm not even 21 yet. I know I have time. I need to use it. I guess this rant has gone on long enough. How did everyone else get past this kind of trauma, if they had something similar?

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Hi everyone,

I'm not even sure this is the right place to post, but I figured it was worth a try.

Years ago, I noticed something strange — whenever a partner of mine drank a certain type of alcohol, the smell on their breath would deeply repulse me. What stood out is that this reaction didn’t happen with anyone else, only romantic partners. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it always stuck with me.

Fast forward a few years, I decided to try ketamine therapy to help with depression, anxiety, and some emotional blockages. Unfortunately, the experience turned out to be traumatic. The company I used was remote, and I believe the dosage they prescribed was far too high. From what I’ve read since, I ended up in what’s called a “K-hole.” Coming out of it, something unexpected happened — that same repulsive smell came to mind very vividly, and along with it, a specific person (we'll call him Bob, my aunt's ex-husband). It was disorienting, to say the least.

When I brought this up with my parents, they were almost adamant that it didn’t mean anything. Still, I couldn’t shake it, so I began trying to piece together any relevant memories. The challenge is... I don’t remember much of my childhood at all.

There are two moments that stand out, though, and they’ve always felt strange:

1. Bob once told my aunt that he saw me, as a teenager, steal money from his wallet. That never happened.
2. As an adult, I was preparing to move to Mexico with a partner and attended a family gathering before leaving. Bob told me how happy he was for me — but the way he said it felt oddly out of place, even unsettling. It didn’t match the dynamic we’ve ever had.

Lately, I’ve started somatic therapy because I’ve been feeling stuck, like something inside is blocking me from fully living my life. The first session was intense. When I described what was coming up in my body, the therapist asked if she could pose a delicate question. She then gently asked whether I had ever experienced sexual trauma. The moment she asked, I felt like I was going to cry, but I couldn’t.

In the second session, I had sensations that felt like I was drowning. The image that kept surfacing was a lakehouse — one that Bob rented after divorcing my aunt. I don’t know why that location popped into my head, but it did.

I’m not really sure what the point of sharing all this is. Maybe it’s just to get it out of my head and into the world. Maybe someone out there has had a similar experience. Honestly, I don't even know if any of this is “real” or just my mind playing tricks on me — but it's weighing on me, and I guess I just needed to say it somewhere.

Thanks for reading.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: Does anyone else have a time in their life they look back and can't really recall what actually happened? There's a few moments in my life wherein I have very distinct memories, and then there's other times where I struggle to remember what actually happened? For example, I had a terrible time in 2019 and went through one of the most difficult moments in my life. This involved a very toxic (for the other party and myself) situationship. I often try to reflect back and try to understand why, when I've reached out for closure before, the other party has never given it to me. Nowadays, when I think back to things he said and told others, though I remember my own stance I how I felt, I feel confused? He told others I lied, miscommunicated or "made him the villain", when I don't remember it that way. There's other examples, but this is the most prominent one for me. It always leaves me feeling upset, confused and like I could be am an evil, manipulative or fake person because I can't re-collect this time from the perspective he shared or I've heard he shared from others. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

Original Idea: >!When I was 10(M) I had made a friend with a girl 12(F) and we were good friends, and I looked up to her, but she had a lot of problems, and she took them out on me (usually yelling at me, cutting herself because "of me", etc) but one day she just looked down one day at school, then said "thank you for all you have done, let me reward you." She took me to the one stall bathroom in the school, and proceeded to rape me. I said no, but I didn't resist because I didn't want to lose her. When it was over, she told me that "If I rat her out, she'd kill herself." until the school year ended, I proceeded to wet my bed for months, but when school ended, she went to middle school, while i was still in elementary. For 6th grade, I forced myself to forget that she took advantage of me, and I did forget, but that denial caused me to start self-harming. When I went to her middle school (7th grade now), she had friends. She was (at least trying to be) happy, and the part that hurt me the most is that she was having sex with everyone like a rabbit, and the thought of that made me upset, but I had no idea why, so instead I started touching myself constantly and daily, not for pleasure, but just to cope. Eventually we had an argument, which caused in her parents telling my mom that I'm a "fuckboy who's no good for our daughter." Which caused my parents to make me stop talking with her. Throughout the school year, I was getting silently tormented by her friends and boyfriends constantly, which then resulted in a suicide attempt. I survived, and I was getting better. A year and a half later, I kept on having dreams about what she did to me, which I was originally in denial about, but then I accepted it. It took me a month to tell me my parents, and then we reported it to the police. I don't know how she's doing, but the thought of her changing for the better made me want to kill somebody. Every time I have an argument, I go to my room, and cut/touch myself to the thought of her hurting me. I hate how I don't want her to change. I hate how disgusting I am. I hate it. But then I remembered her discord username, so I gave it to my friend, and they started talking online (with him having a fake name). She seems better, but like I said, that idea makes me sick. Now I don't know what to do. She most likely hates me but even with that, I love her. I scroll through our old chats to see the bad memories of what she did to me, but it gives me a feeling of ecstasy and pleasure just seeing her profile picture. I don't know what to do. !<>!&#x200B;!<

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: For the longest time, I’ve wondered: Am I really in a messed-up family, or am I just victimizing myself? I'm being honest here—because I have no one else to confide in.

For context, I’m a 18-year-old girl from an Indian household. I’m about to attend college abroad, so yes, my family is financially comfortable. I come from a family of four—my parents, my younger brother, and me. We also have extended family: my uncle, aunt, and grandparents.

So this is how the story goes.

Ever since I was little—around 4 or 5—I remember my mom’s angry outbursts and crying. I unfortunately have a good memory when it comes to bad incidents.

The fights were always over small things: I didn’t study, or my father didn’t come home. My mom had to manage everything on her own—me and my little brother—because my grandparents were, to put it bluntly, psychotic. They hated her for being a girl child, and praised my uncle for simply being male. My grandfather acted like everyone existed to serve him.

That’s a whole other post. There’s too much lore.

They constantly made snide comments about my mom—even though she was the smartest and most capable person in the family. We’re all, including my dad and me, genuinely grateful to her. But she had a bad temper and was stuck with this 90s “ideal family” mindset that ate away at her.

For "prestige," my grandfather married her off into a lower-income family—pretty much the level of his car driver. But my mom wanted to escape her own family, and my dad, though poor, was hardworking, had no bad habits, and was kind. So she married him.

Only after the wedding did she realize that my dad’s family treated him like a servant. That’s another saga entirely.

So she rescued him. They cut off both toxic families and started fresh. My mom taught my dad how to present himself, how to speak, how to earn. She gave up her comfort, paid off his debts—even while seven months pregnant. She made sacrifices I can’t even list. When I was born, they had no choice but to both work, and I was left with my grandparents when I was just 7 days old. They visited every weekend, crying. My grandparents continued calling me a burden. After 3 months, my mom finally quit her job and took me back.

My uncle was also living with us. He refused to help—wouldn’t even watch me when my mom had to run errands for him. Eventually, my dad got him a job and helped him build a life.

When my brother was born, my grandparents and uncle treated us like house-help. Around this time (I was 4), my dad began constructing a building—10 years of stress, debt, and nonstop pressure. My mom was stuck inside the house with toddlers, isolated, overwhelmed. And my dad? He didn’t even take her out or talk to her.

So the fights began.

And they only got worse.

I would often try to step in, to stop them. My mom would ask, “Can’t you see I’m right?” and then guilt me for not siding with her. She said my dad was emotionless—and she wasn’t entirely wrong. He’d just shut down or go to sleep while she cried and screamed.

They fought almost every weekend. I even used to mark our calendar with fight days vs. peace days. But over time, the peace days dwindled. One month, they fought every single day.

My mom screamed and cried. My dad gaslighted and manipulated her. My brother and I were stuck in the crossfire.

Then came 2021. The worst year. They had always held off fighting on my birthday—until then. That year, they didn’t even pretend to care.

That’s when I started thinking maybe I shouldn’t have been born. That dying might be easier than living.

When my dad is in a rage, he loses control. And when that happens, my mom turns suicidal—literally trying to jump, run, or hurt herself. My brother and I would have to drag her into our room, lock the door, and physically block it while my dad pounded on the other side.

My mom, in her breakdown, would hit us for not letting her go back to him.

We were terrified she’d kill herself.

And as for my dad? I don’t believe he’d intentionally hurt us. But in his rage... I honestly don’t know anymore.

This started when I was 14. From that point, I stopped being the quiet, kind kid. I became angry ,frustrated. Unstable. I began shouting back.

But my mom told me not to interfere—it would ruin my education.

Those years were also when I became suicidal. I felt like dying and hurting myself, the numbing sensation never felt so great. I swallowed down screams. I never cried—I thought crying made me weak. So I bottled it all up. Still do.

Every time I thought of dying, though, I remembered others have it worse. And I felt selfish. Like I was being dramatic. Like maybe I was just victimizing myself.

So I studied.

I buried myself in books. I knew if I stayed here any longer, I’d lose myself completely. I wanted out. I wanted to study abroad and then drag my little brother out too.

I did everything I could. I got in. The tuition is massive—but my parents agreed to pay it. They were proud. And that’s when the guilt hit me.

How lucky I am to have parents who’ll support me.

How selfish I must be to think they’re bad.

But at the same time…

Did I actually suffer?

Or am I just being dramatic?

Because yes—my family did so much for me. They have the right to be fed up. But is it ever okay to raise kids in this kind of environment?

I had friends whose parents praised them just for trying. Who had dinner together. Whose parents smiled when they helped out. Meanwhile, I was just trying not to get yelled at for losing 1 mark, for making noise while filling the water bottle, or for having a bent page in my notebook.

I’m not even sure what kind of response I’m looking for here.

I just needed to say it out loud.

Maybe just someone to say I’m not imagining it.

That this actually was traumatic.

Thanks for reading.

Original Idea: Hi, I was wondering if my extremely premature and traumatic birth could have contributed to my adult diagnosis of CPTSD, even though I don't remember my birth?

I also experienced mistreatment by adults and peers in my life which also led to my CPTSD (and DID) diagnoses, but what I am focusing on in this post is my extremely premature/traumatic birth and long stay in the NICU.

I was born at 25 weeks gestation and spent 103 days in the NICU. I had a collapsed lung filled with fluid and had to have surgery to reinflate it, I had a nasal cannula (that I kept ripping out resulting in deformed cartilage around my nostrils) a feeding tube, a hole in my heart (which luckily healed by itself one day before my scheduled heart surgery) and more problems. I had a 50% chance of survival and had to be delivered by emergency C-section with the umbilical cord wrapped around my neck.

As a young adult I suffer from CPTSD, Autism, ADHD, DID, BPD, DPD, chronic pain, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome/hypermobility, IBS/chronic stomach pain, and more. I suspect that at least SOME of my problems including CPTSD were caused by my extremely premature birth. Does anyone have a similar experience?

Original Idea: Hi, I’m a 21 year old female, and I’m really struggling with a specific situation that happened when I was 16. In my opinion, this is nothing compared to other things I’ve dealt with- and it could have been a lot worse. 
I’ve had my share of trauma- death, domestic abuse, childhood trauma, etc. 
When I was 16, I was about 6 months pregnant and still living at home with my family; my mom, sister, step father (who, by the way, was absolutely awesome to my mother and to me- for 8 years), and his daughter also lived with us. One night, I get off of work after a long shift. I’m exhausted from working double that day, and I go to my room, and lock the door so my sisters wouldn’t bother me. After about 10 minutes, I hear a knock on the door and fake sleep ( thinking it was one of my sisters). It was persistent and quiet, so I finally answered. I open and it’s my stepdad, who walks in immediately. I panicked, asking what was wrong, considering this wasn’t a normal thing. He says oh nothing, I was just wondering if you’d let me eat your p****. I was absolutely shocked, taken back, and genuinely thought this has to be some type of sick joke. I started yelling for my mom when I realized he was serious, and he grabbed my arm and locked the door, trying to touch me. My mom came up and he decided to leave the room, and go to his room. I locked me and my mom in the door and he came knocking a few minutes later, asking to come in. I had a feeling in my gut to not let him in. 
I finally work up the courage to leave, without my mom and sister. I ran and left the house with nothing but my phone and charger. Come to find out, he went outside shortly after i left, with a gun in his waistband, that he had when he came in my room, and was threatening suicide. My mom and sister left and eventually he had a stand off with police. He later admitted to nurses, police, and psychologists that he apparently had sex with me, which was far from the truth. I wouldn’t let that mother fucker lay a finger on me. 
The months after, I moved out, and was constantly followed and threatened by his adult son. I suffered severe paranoia (I was absolutely terrified they were going to find me and kill me). 
I guess what I am confused about is why is this specific event so hard to get over. I’ve dealt with a dead body in my lap, one of my best friends died 3 years ago, childhood trauma, domestic violence (my ex pointed a gun in my face, along with several other things ), and countless other traumas. And this is the one I just can’t let go. I’m filled with disgust, and disappointment knowing I trusted him so much and then he propositioned me in this way. It has truly changed me in so many ways and I just want to close this chapter. It’s been 5 years, and I still fear him and I can’t think about what’s happened without wanting to vomit. 
I would like to mention that my mom took him back, eventually left after he found a new girl, but I’ve never went back and had to figure out life on my own at 16. 
I would also like to add, I now have the best little family ever. I’m engaged, just bought a house, and truly thriving in the life I’ve dreamed of.

Original Idea: I was a horrible partner, it was my first relationship ever, and oh boy was I over the moon. The problem? My trauma of my father touching me inappropriately, nothing like physical aside from touching, as well as struggling with major depression and ocd that was not diagnosed at the time.

So while I loved the man, yearned for him and his love, it was like being torn apart on the inside. Like the touch that I loved so much made me want to puke when the thoughts went to, well, my father. I also had fantasies of creating a family together with him and just feeling happy. But I just got too anxious, and our first try lasted 1-2 weeks. I was absolutely crushed, like I felt like a failure. But I had to break it off, I was just panicking with every action, every message was me struggling not to get a panic attack and I felt way too overwhelmed. And I was a coward and did it over fucking telegram, yikes, do I regret that one. We still continued as friends, and half a year later, tried again. Lasted for about a month, and then for the same reasons, I broke it off again. It was a terrible year for me in general, starting uni and living on my own, which didn't go well at the beginning, then I had friendship problems, the whole relationship thing, my family depending on me with my mom calling me over 3 times a day, ext. Like there was a ton going on and I should not even have began that relationship, I just felt so happy in his presence while also being torn up inside by a monster that was eating my guts.

We broke up for the last time for six hours and ended up being friends. After this, I went on a trip abroad, and he got mad at me for not talking things through before I left, so we stopped talking to each other for two years as of now. Even to this day, I am not sure on why he started to avoid me. Like he wanted to talk about how to handle our relationship going forward and I had to postpone it as it was my dream vacation I had been waiting on and I had to leave to go to the airport later. This went as far as him not even saying hello while we met at university. Not like I blame him, I was a terrible partner as I was on the cusp of being suicidal. But did it hurt? Yes, I ton.

Now, I am doing well, with therapy over the year and medication that actually works. So I got my life fairly well together, so last March, I contacted him for the first time, to just say sorry for everything I did and that I am sorry I hurt him, even saying I didn't expect a reply, just wanted him to know it. Well, he blocked me and never read the message, did it hurt? Yes, but I deserved that one. Yesterday I had to contact him because of a school project and we were talking for the first time like strangers with perfect grammar and everything, that hurt too like this was the man I once dreamed of having children with and now we can barely even talk.

It is just one of the biggest regrets in my life on how I treated him. Yes, I did it because of trauma and being in a very bad mental state but that doesn't take away from me hurting him. And do I still miss him in my life even if I in no way deserve to have him, also yes. But he cannot even stand my guts it is seems and I just hate that I was able to hurt a person like that. I never wanted this to happen, I just wanted to be loved for once in my life.

He was not a perfect person but my god was he a gentle soul that did his best to support me even if he did not understand the severity of my problems. But that was the problem, he was supporting me and we were not in balance. I just wish I could travel back in time to fix it to keep from hurting him. I just feel horrible on how things went and sometimes miss him too. But I never deserved that man

Original Idea: I just turned 22 a couple of weeks ago. Like many others, birthdays are extremely hard for me. They give me such a weird feeling—maybe it’s because I never pictured myself turning 22. Hell, I didn’t think I would make it past 18. But for the past two years, I’ve tried my very hardest to turn that around.

My job is okay for a college student. I’m investing more into my education. I’m trying to be a better friend and sibling. I’m trying—for what seems like the first time in my life. And most importantly, I’m trying to learn how to let things go.

I was bullied in elementary school (that’s not the part I’m hung up on. I’m grown; I’m not crying about how other kids treated me). I’ve had sports equipment thrown at me by classmates. I’ve had trash bins tossed over restroom stalls while I was using them. Been called names—like anyone else. But it all went downhill when my parents got involved.

I’ve never had amazing parents. But they were good. They made sure I had a roof over my head, food to eat, and clothes to wear. Did they beat me? Yeah, but who wasn’t? My parents’ solution to the bullying wasn’t to complain to the school or tell me that shitty line, “kids can be cruel.” No. They made me do five sets of 50 jumping jacks every day, eat Lean Cuisine frozen meals, and bought me clothes that were too small as motivation to lose weight. I was 11–14 years old. Of course all of that would give a young girl self-esteem issues. (Yeah, it’s sad—but I’m over it. That’s not the issue I’m addressing.)

Right before the COVID lockdown, I was in high school. Like any teenager, I was acting out—skipping school, having an attitude, grades dropping—anything but drugs and drinking. The school called my parents and told them to get me a therapist, and they did. During one session, the therapist told my parents to keep an eye on me, “just in case anything happened.”

Then the lockdown happened. I had to get a new therapist. It was absolutely horrible. He was a middle-aged straight white guy who grew up in the Midwest. Not saying there’s anything wrong with that, but we had nothing in common. I was a teenage lesbian Asian girl who grew up in a big city.

One day, I told my dad I needed a new therapist. He was pretty understanding, but he asked me to just put up with the sessions for another week, just to be sure I didn’t like it. I did my little Zoom therapy session and sat in silence the whole time. I was so incredibly frustrated that I started to cry after the session.

My dad came into the room and told me it was time to get on the treadmill (at the time, I had to run on it for an hour a day). I was crying and told him to give me a minute to stop, and then I’d get on. A couple of minutes later, I was walking toward the treadmill, and my dad stopped me, saying how all “I do is cry, cry, cry. If I looked better, I wouldn’t cry as much. Don’t bother getting on the treadmill. You’ll never change.” I walked back to my room and cried. It wasn’t sad crying—it was frustration.

He texted me to give him my laptop and phone. I was being punished now. I gave him my stuff and went back to my room. I had nothing to do, so I took a nap.

I woke up to my dad screaming and throwing things in my room. I had never seen him like that before. I had never been scared of my dad—I didn’t know what he was going to do. I stayed in the fetal position, pretending to be asleep. All I could hear was my dad pulling my dresser to the ground, throwing my record player on the floor, smashing my candles against the wall, pulling my TV off the wall.

I laid there and, for the first time since I was eight, I prayed. I’m not religious—and neither is my family, with my mom being the outlier. I prayed to whatever god might listen, begging that my mom would come home and stop him. That she would protect me. And in some miracle, my mom came home.

She walked into my room. I was still curled up, pretending to be asleep. And in some sick, twisted joke from the gods, she leaned over me and said, “Never in my life have I been so disrespected. If it wasn’t illegal, I’d throw you out of the damn house and have you begging on the corner. You’ll end up just like your aunt.” (My aunt is a raging drug addict and gang member. I’ve never touched a single drug in my life.)

“I’ve given you everything, and you’re still a shit daughter.”

I completely lost it. I got up and ran to the bathroom. My mom was banging on the door, demanding I open it so she could “beat my ass.” I guess my dad started to feel bad and told her to stop. And like a switch, he whispered through the door, “Do you want me to call your sister?” I told him, “Yes, please.”

My sister came home from work to comfort me. She told me to take a shower so I’d feel a bit better while she cleaned up the destruction in my room. After I showered, my dad called me into his room and told me to sit down. He went on about how “all I want is for you to be happy,” and “if I could kill myself for you to be happy, I would.” He told me he loved me, and that my mom would be driving me to a mental facility to be watched because they thought I’d kill myself after all that.

On the drive to the hospital, my mom was begging me not to go—telling me to text my dad and say I was okay and wanted to come home. I didn’t.

No one in my family has talked about that day ever since. It’s like it never happened.

I’m still so confused about what made my parents so angry with me that day. That happened a few years ago, and it’s still all I think about at 2 a.m. It keeps me up at night. I can’t sleep in the fetal position anymore—that’s how I was laying when my parents did that. They’re still worried about my mental health and check on me every now and then, but they still wonder why I’m more “sensitive” than my siblings.

I need help. I can’t stop remembering that day. I’ll be having a nice dinner with my family, and that memory will just pop up. I don’t want to see a therapist because when I talk about it, it only makes things worse. I need help, but I don’t know where to get it from. (Sorry for the long post, rambling, and spelling/grammar.)

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: For years, I thought my inner critic was me.. Turns out, it was just a collection of my mother’s fears, silence, shame, stitched into something that sounded like my own thoughts! Can you relate?

It took me a long time to realize that healing isn’t about becoming someone new, but about finally meeting the version of you that never had the chance to exist in safety.

I recently published my first book: The Bruises We Can’t See, under the name Luna Thomsen. It’s not a guide. It’s just what I wish I’d had: someone saying, “You’re not crazy. It happened. And it hurt.”

For anyone navigating the mess of memory, trauma, and self-worth: you’re not alone in it. Truly.

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: So my mother’s egg donor decided to move to the town we live in about 13 blocks from us and she moved my second eldest brother with her. This dude is 24 and decided to finally get off his ass for once and do something and when I refused to help move their stuff bcuz it’s my 1 day off a week doing 9-12 hour shifts everyday and overnights twice a week he decides to start talking shit. He proceed to go in on our mother about us being lazy pieces of shit. Mind you this man is 24 working a job making excuses on why he can’t take a shower says trauma which I understand is a valid reason. But lemme give you a bit of background on my family: my mom 44 was r-worded by her eldest brother from the time she was 4 until she was married at 17(there is proof) my mothers egg donor says she was r-worded by her eldest brother but she’s a hypochondriac and likes to be center of attention and there is no proof, my father that raised me aka 24 y/o father was r-worded by his eldest brother and beat along w his mother and younger sister, me I was r-worded by the 24 y/o from the time I was about 5 until we were in foster care at 6 then started again in the 4th grade when he used to visit then stopped when I was in the 7th grade when I told and he got charged and I was threatened by said mothers egg donor to say it was a lie then from 12-15 I didn’t see him he came home in late 2018 and started again until we moved to Florida at 16 then started again when I was 17 2 months before my 18th and hasn’t since I turned 18. Now with all that in mind back to the story, he got angry and tried to out his hands on me bcuz I said he was lazy and throwing a fit like a child bcuz we refuse to help someone that has taked shit told lies  and abused us our whole lives currently and past (24 year old had bad anger issues and since he was like 5 used to kick hit punch and break stuff over our mother like his father did as well) I told him he can talk shit about us but it doesn’t change the fact that he’s just like his father and it’s why we don’t wanna be around so he told em to get off his property I told him it isn’t his he didn’t pay for shit and he’s just mad bcuz he’s forced to live w moms egg donor I told me to stfu I told him that rapist don’t get to tell me what to do he said he wasn’t one. I told him the only reason why mom is tryna prove a point to him about not abandoning him is bcuz he makes her feel bad that he was in the system longer than us and bcuz he turned out just like his father and his uncle. He got mad moms egg donor told me to STFU and I went further said that moms egg donor only wants him to live w her along w my youngest brother is bcuz her son turned into a rapist and a fuck up and she’s trying to fix her mistakes but it seems she failed bcuz just like our great uncle, our uncle, his uncle, and his cousin there’s another rapist biological to all 4 of them and my youngest brother will never turn out like them. Then I packed my shit w my mother sister and youngest brother and left to our house after he said he didn’t want to hear or see any of us again.

Original Idea: hi!! throwaway account. I just thought id come on here to ask for some ideas from the community for my final therapy session. i was raped 3 years ago and ive been in therapy for 2 years for it. Sadly i have only 2 more sessions with my therapist who has helped me so much through my trauma and i genuinley feel so much better. We were discussing doing something to symbolise moving on from the trauma, and i am just trying to generate some ideas. I still have the top i was wearing when i was raped, i was thinking maybe i could cut it up or something physical, would love to burn it but obviously i cant really do that with my therapist and i want it to be with her. Does anyone have any other ideas? id like it to be rather physical (eg like involving an object- i just prefer this as it feels more real) but it doesnt have to involve the top, it could be anything. Any ideas welcome! thank you

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: So I have a shit ton of trauma generally speaking. Both mommy and daddy issues but the mommy issues takes the cake 🎂 

But this is about my father.

When I was a little girl, I would feel uncomfortable around him.
 
I wasn’t always like that tho. But I think I was developing the feeling of “uncomfortableness” slightly before the age of 12.  

But when I was 12 years old it was PEAK uncomfortableness.

It was just this underlying feeling. He grossed me out and creeped me out. 

The man was hella clingy. He would demand for hugs all the time. Even when I said no. Even when I tried to push him off of him and scream. He thought it was funny. It was just hugs after all.

But I would hide away from him. Under the bed just to avoid his hugs. Lock myself in the bathroom too. But he would always find me and demand for hugs.

Eventually I learned that you might as well give in cause what’s the point of saying no? It’s gonna happen anyways you might as well get over it fast by giving him what he wants.

If you rewind time, and see how I acted with him at the Kingdom Hall (I grew up as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses but I’m inactive now) I would always try to avoid sitting next to him.

If I had to sit next to him my body would lean to the other side.

Or if I could I would leave a seat empty between us and use it as where by bags will rest. Just to keep a little bit of distance between us. To make me feel safe.

Hugs are just hugs. 

To be real with y’all he’s a bit on the spectrum so I always left room for doubt. I didn’t wanted to believe that he liked me more than a daughter. But I was paranoid of the possibility.

But one day something really alarming happened at the kingdom Hall.

I was 12

I had to sit next to him but with bags in between us. He wouldn’t leave me alone with all of his attention. Licking his lips. And grunting. 

The song ended. The prayer ended.

And I quickly huddle close to my mother to avoid my father. Seeking shelter.

And all of a sudden i felt someone lick the back of my left ear.

I FREAKED TFFFFF OUT AND I TURNED AROUND AND ITS MY FATHER

I PLEADED TO MY MOM FOR HELP AND TOLD HER WHAT MY DAD DID. And she was confused and kind of concerned. And told him to stop.

My dad didn’t took it too seriously. And seem unbothered and he felt gross.


You know what writing this all made me realize yeah. I’m in denial. He’s was a pedo isn’t he???

Idkkkkk

Cause the funny thing is that when I grew older the less and less creepy he felt. And the less and less he demanded for hugs.

Was it about control? Or was he just TRULY DISGUSTINGLY SICK IN THE HEAD.

Well he’s sick in the head either way. But you know what I mean.

Original Idea: I recently remembered this experience as I was scrolling through TikTok and came across the trauma candy salads it was shocking and some even funny at first but I remembered what happened when I went to Brazil at the beginning of the summer and I cannot believe I didn’t remember this . Some context. My brother is 22 . One day I went trick or treating with my old best friend, it was fun . But that quickly changed . I went home cleaned up and go ready for bed . I woke up with someone telling me to put my hands up . Mind you I was sleeping with no shirt on with only my underwear on waking up with armed men inside my house. Turned out it was the fbi . They sat me down infront of my house along my parents my sister and my brother . No one explained anything until I saw my stepbrother and asked him what was going on he also said he didn’t know but I heard the person from the fbi asking him if his brother ever did anything to him which was weird because his brother would never do anything like that of course he said no and they sat me down with everyone again . I later found out my brother had downloaded videos of children and he ended up going to jail for it whatever he’s out now . He’s 22 , im not even close to that age yet not revealing my age but keep that in mind . As any teen who’s hormonal and horny all the time ofc u watch stuff and do stuff . My dad and my brother live in Brazil where we used to live before we moved to the us in the us it is only me my sister and mother now me and my mom went there just to visit to reconnect with family because we hadn’t been there in years . In my house everyone asleep . My brother was gaming in a different room of the house but he never really came out at night so as any teen does I pulled up a video and started yk. Anyways . My brother came out of the room saw me watched me stared at me. He then went to the bathroom then came back and layed next to me . I’m
Not sure how to process this or how to even tell my family about this . Idk if they would believe me and i sure as hell don’t know how to tell them how it happened.

Original Idea: CW :for grooming, bullying, S/A?, physical abuse , dementia and self-harm

Original Idea: Please read fully before responding :)

- Bullying causes trauma because as hunter gatherers if you were outcasted you would likely die, same as SA and losing a parent etc.

- The idea that certain traumas “count more” is a cultural invention, not rooted in how trauma actually works in the brain. There’s no levels to trauma

- It wasn’t regular bullying, I had a textbook bully who even tortured me once and my experiences with him never cross my mind

- it was existing in a ghetto liberal casually anti-white culture, 30% of them would be anti-white and the rest would turn a blind eye

- Sometimes I would count and hear 18 anti-white remarks in a day and sometimes 0

- My dad would say anti white things as well

- Schools said everyone except straight white males be proud of yourself and celebrated everyone except straight white males via “culture days” and the intercom and posters and liberal teachers etc.

- The main stream media followed woke ideology

- Woke ideology says straight white males are bad and are at the bottom of the woke social hierarchy and shames them via “white privelege”

- Indians and East Asians do better than whites at everything except government representation, Indians and Asians even do better in the justice system and police interactions, Indians are starting to increase their government representation and it won’t be long before they do better than whites at literally everything per capita, therefore the narrative of white privilege doesn’t hold up anymore

- Every interface except a handful of white kids at my school fed that anti-white narrative to my subconscious mind

- I’m not the fragile one for naming the reality I lived through.

- I’m not the one denying someone else’s experience because it makes me uncomfortable.

- I’m not the one outsourcing my thinking to a social ideology.

- narratives don’t equal reality

- I don’t need to prove anything to anyone

- I don’t need validation from people who don’t respect me

## Mental Health - Trauma
Original Idea: 

I’m 14m and lately my life has been really hard. This happened two months ago: My dad (who’s an alcoholic) started hitting me randomly so I tried to defend myself, then he grabs a screwdriver and he tried cutting his veins and then blamed me, saying I’m destroying the family, saying that I'm gonna die and I'm gonna burning in hell. Than my brother (whos 8) and my mother enters in the room and my dad saying that I was a monster and he told to my brother to never trust me again, and he casually gave a slap to my mother and he started beating her, I jumped and I tried to defend my mom and my dad beated me brutally, in the head and in my chest, he hit me so hard I couldn't breath for almost a minute and then he tried to go away, so I taked the key and putted them under my pillow, than he did go to sleep. I knew that he was gonna do something really bad to himself or me so I stayed awake and when he wake up at like 3 am I runned to the bathroom, closed the door and the was trying to break it, than he said that if I wasn't gonna leave from the bathroom he was gonna go away, I didn't opened the door and my dad did go away. 
I can't sleep, I remember everything, every detail, he was dressed with a green t shirt and blue jeans. I hate myself, is my fault, why the fuck did I protected myself? I could have just stayed there without defending myself and nothing would have happened.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my mother is also a piece of shit, she also did horrible stuff

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Hey r/mentalhealth! We're looking to grow our moderation team. Moderators are a key part of what makes any reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What do the mods do?

Moderators here on mentalhealth work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of mental health and the ways that mental health and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply? Can I apply if I've never been a moderator before?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about mental health and the r/mentalhealth community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com)

# What are the expectations for moderators who join the r/mentalhealth mod team?

Mod team members need to be a part of the team. We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our mod team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Is there anything I should know about moderating r/mentalhealth before I apply?

Yes. r/mentalhealth is a support community for mental health and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a modmail indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/mentalhealth?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your modmail and your application. We may ask for some additional information about your moderation experience and how familiar you are with reddit. We may use a google form to structure those questions.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/mentalhealth moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about four weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!

Original Idea: Edit: He has died.

A week ago I separated from my husband. It had been coming for a very long time but it still hurts. I have been living a lie when I was pretending my marriage could be saved and instead of admitting the truth, i went through an IOP. We were together for 10 years, married for 8, but struggling for 5. We have agreed this is the right path forward but damn it hurts. 

Tonight I got a message from my mother telling me that my older brother, who raped me for 4 years, only has a couple of days to live. He is dying of tongue cancer after having his tongue removed last year. I did not celebrate his surgery but I was glad that he could never enjoy food or call people horrible names anymore. 

Now I am just completely overwhelmed. I am moving across the country in 10 days and just don't have the bandwidth for this. 

I am strong and I know none of these things will bring me to my knees, but dang.

I don't have a question, I just need to say tge hard parts

I have no idea why, but my mind stops talking after a few minutes.

I feel like I’m losing control of my mind, and I don’t understand what’s happening. I sometimes get these awful, intrusive thoughts like hurting my mom or throwing my dog.. and they terrify me. I would never want to do these things, but the fact that they even pop into my head makes me feel sick and scared.

Why would someone think like this? Am I going crazy? I’m so disturbed and worried something is wrong with me. Please, if anyone knows why this happens or what I should do, tell me. I just want these thoughts to stop.

Original Idea: I'm 14M and been bullied my whole life. I've felt more like an animal than a human since 6th grade, because of how poorly I've been treated. I have never been seen as a human by any of my peers.

Self harm is the only thing that makes me feel like I'm a human. Like I'm one of them. Seeing my own blood reminds me that I'm a person. It reminds me that people bleed, and so do I. It only really reminds me for a little bit, maybe 15 minutes, until I forget again.

Original Idea: If anybody sees that, I just wonder if you can help me, so basically for the past whole year I’ve been struggling with some issues like depression and anxiety (which I still have some social anxiety). I used to be a very happy person, I used to do what I loved, enjoy with my friends, and just live my life like a normal teenager. But I’ve been through a serious change with my personality, i would say I grew up, I became quiet and “relaxed”. And because of that I slowly stopped talking to my friends too. My biggest problem is that even today, I carry a lot of negative energy from the things I’ve been through this year. The most major one is my sense of excitement. I completely lost all interest in the stuff I used to love, my motivation to go to the gym is just gone, and the gym used to be my passion. And it still is my passion, but I don’t even have the motivation to walk outside. Just staying in bed, playing video games all day.

Lol kinda long 😅

Original Idea: Somehow I remember how a few years ago I had a few instances where I was fighting with my ex and I was so angry and willing to defend myself to get him out of my apartment, that I was not afraid to get hurt. Even though I am a weak girl I did not care if he fought back and I would have wounds, I would fight to get him out.

I also wonder if this is a part of mania or maybe just adrenaline where I was thinking like; okay, try me if you dare, and I could get all the emotional pain and frustration out that they caused me. I did not want to hurt them and don’t want to hurt people. It was just like this overload of emotions that made me want to ‘crash out’.

This thought process actually started when I saw some TikTok videos about manic eyes. I was wondering if I would have those eyes. Again I don’t know if this is a bpd thing but i’m wondering if anyone else who has bpd can relate this?

Original Idea: Something that is slowly driving me mad is my deep empathy. Empathy is great but too much of it is horrible. I constantly put myself in people's shoes which ruins my mood.

 Why am I caring soo much about you not being able to use your arm!? I can't do anything about it so why am I soo bothered. 

It just angers me how I could ruin my own mood because of my empathy.

Laying down 
Covered up head to toe 

Here I lay 
With all my dread
Succumbed by every thought

Here I pray
To no one but me 

Why, me why must I cry 

Tell me why do I feel so cold 

Tell me why do I feel so cold

Why do I feel so…


I want to cry 
I want to scream
I want to punch myself until I bleed 

I want to cut myself until I can’t move


Everyone hates me 
Everyone hates me 
Everyone hates me 

Everyone 
Everyone 
Everyone

Original Idea: M30 South Asian

I've done various drugs since I was 15.

Racked up an unmanageable amount of debt and ruined my credit score.

Finances are completely shit.

Ruined every genuine relationship in my life.

Work a job where I'm ridiculed and all of my pay goes into debt and food.

I don't have a shred of confidence in my body.

I live in a family of 6, where I'm the only one with a stable source of income.

I find 0 to little joy in anything.

My Dad's coming close to his deathbed from old age, and I don't know how I'm supposed to handle anything in his absence.

I suffer from horrible anxiety and depression and have been taking medication for over 10 years.

I've done therapy for several years with various therapists and found it completely ineffective.

Medication has dulled my senses completely.

The only good thing I've done is stay sober from drugs and alcohol for 120+ days.

There is pressure on me to get married, there is pressure on me to become more capable 

But all I really want is just to go to sleep and not wake up the next day.

Original Idea: As someone who has BPD I have troubles with dating. Specially during the talking stage I end up putting others on a pedestal and don’t realize it.

I always once I connect with people and develop a crush I put them on a pedestal and find it hard to not want to talk to them all the time. It’s so hard for me to get into a healthy conversation because I don’t want to reveal my own trauma and shit I’ve been through on the first date or 2 as it should be getting to vibe but always end up saying something about an ex because of my trust issues and no one needs to be hearing the word ex on first date because wouldn’t it just mean I’m still in love with them?? 

But I hate small talk it makes me cringe even tho I do it with parents and other teachers I just have a hard time with caring about bullshit answers when I don’t care about the weather I can fucking see it with my own eyes or how your day was I can tell by looking at you how your day was or feel your emotions and know how you will be for the whole time.


But when I start liking someone all my rational thoughts run away it’s like my inner child or something comes forth and wants to scare others away but in reality she’s just looking for someone to love and to love her back.

Original Idea: I despise my appearance, and I honestly don't know what to do about it. I have an ugly face, terrible hair, small penis, weird head shape. I really hate how I look, and honestly it has been driving me insane. I know I need to learn how to love myself, but I don't think I'll ever be able to do so without being able to look good. It's driving me crazy, and it's making me become a worse person. The little personality I had is being drained by my hatred towards my own body. I'm scared of what I'll do to myself

Original Idea: My psychiatrist told me that everyone disassociates to some degree. Mentally ill people experience disassociation to a higher degree. Just because you disassociate does not mean you have a dissociative disorder.

She was telling me this because I told her I had an alter who I used to switch with all the time when I was younger. Then she said that with my current diagnoses (Schizoaffective Bipolar Type, OCD, and PTSD due to suspected brain damage) may explain my dissociative symptoms which I due indeed have. She says we will have to continually consider it as Dissociative Identity Disorder can be mistaken for schizophrenia early on in treatment. But she felt that my current diagnoses very well may explain my dissociative symptoms. As she’s never seen my alter (one I ignore and deny now we are no longer friends I don’t invite him to control me anymore) she was more confident leaving the diagnoses as is. 

Just wanted to share the tid bit of information that I learned today. Disassociating happens to everyone, and to a higher degree if you are mentally ill. Just because you disassociate does not mean you have a dissociative disorder.

Good day.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: My situation is actually more complex than that. I struggled my whole life with my mental health, but my challenges became increasingly obvious when I started university. For reference, I moved to London from a small town in Italy at 21 and started an Architecture course at 23 - I never knew what to do with my life and I thought I had somewhat figured it out by then. 
University was a deeply traumatic experience: my struggles became obvious when, compared to my peers, I was unable to handle the workload, the associated stress and “critique” days - where I had to discuss my work standing up in front of fellow students and external critics. I always ended up in tears, I hated that my work was not perfect and felt a lot of shame. I ended up dropping out twice and it took me 6 years and two different universities to complete a 3-years bachelor degree program. 

Having googled my symptoms, such as low mood/depression and suicidal ideation among others, something clicked when I read about ASD. My gp referred me for an assessment and I was diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger’s Syndrome as well as EUPD (or BPD) more recently - the symptoms overlap so it’s difficult to tell them apart. I think the social challenges of AS trigger BPD symptoms. 

The next trauma came when it was time to look for a job. The job market was and still is very bad in architecture and there are more and more expectations to be met straight out of uni. The only question that an employer had for me during an interview was “do you have any experience working in an office?”. Straight out of uni? It’s possible but it’s so wrong to think of that as an essential requirement. 
Anyway.. I had rent and bills to pay, so I turned to baking, which has been my full-time job for the past 5 years. 

Needless to say, I still feel like a failure for not being able to work in architecture, and no amount of CBT and Psychotherapy is going to convince me otherwise. 
Recently, I reached a point where baking is taking a toll on my body - if up to a couple of years ago I felt mentally unfit but physically fit at least, now I am both mentally and physically exhausted. I lost one job after the other due my bluntness towards my colleagues, settling into new teams every time is extremely difficult for someone like me. I started a new job last week and on my 8th shift today I called in sick. I am already tired, I am deeply burnt out and I feel like giving up already but… what am I going to do? 
When looking for alternative careers, nothing appeals me other than maybe photography. But how do I get into it professionally? Job ads demand portfolios and experience.

I feel hopeless and I don’t want to live at all - but I guess that’s for another post. Living shouldn’t be so hard.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I’m in STEM and since January 2024 I’ve gotten laid off twice. A recent round of interviews with a company were very promising. They emailed me saying there were in the approval process to give me an offer. I was beyond happy! I would email them once a week for two weeks just to get an update. It seemed the approval process was taking longer than expected (according to the company) because some people were out on PTO. Makes sense considering it’s summer. This morning I get an email stating that the job has gone to someone else. I’m devastated and beyond broken. I was getting ready to relocate (on my own dime) and start this new role which was perfect. They were going to give me an offer only to rescind it and give it to someone else. They won’t explain their actions. I’m tired of applying for thousands of jobs and getting rejected. I’m 38 and practically broke with no retirement because I had to divest everything for living expenses. My professional life is just nonexistent. 

 On the personal side of things, I’m single and lonely. I want to state that I’m not part of the “male loneliness epidemic” and their whole movement. Friends and family have moved away and I just sit in my place alone talking to my dog. It sucks seeing people on social media flaunt their lives and makes me feel more isolated. 

With these two things, I’m about to give up. Life used to be filled with optimism for me and now it’s just one letdown after another. Nothing in my life sticks and it falls apart in the end. It’s almost as if the universe is giving me the finger and telling me to end things. I’m tired of pushing and pushing. I get exhausted just thinking of living another day. The engine has run out of steam and I just want permanent sleep.

Original Idea: I (17M) became friends with a girl (18F) earlier this year, and over time, we grew very close. Our friendship kept gradually evolving and I achieved the title of a "best friend" from her. We’ve become part of each other’s daily lives and always make time for each other, even when we’re drained from talking to others. I got to know about her BPD a bit later.

We’ve had a few disputes, mostly due to miscommunication and my tendency to avoid bringing up problems. She’s usually the one who pushes me to talk so we can resolve things. I’m trying to change that.

The main issue now is that if I say something that unintentionally upsets her, she sometimes shuts herself off—like deactivating her account—for a while. She admits she’s not sure exactly what triggers her, so she doesn’t want me walking on eggshells. But in those moments, I tend to leave her alone instead of reaching out elsewhere, because I’m terrified of saying something worse. Hurting her repeatedly is the last thing I want, but leaving her alone often makes her feed herself more negative thoughts, which only upsets her more.

She’s told me, “It’s easy for most things to blow over if the person says the right thing,” but I’m never sure what that right thing is. I want to stop upsetting her and prevent her from shutting herself off again. Other than improving my communication skills, what else can I do to prevent this from happening again. I just want to be the better best friend to her. The one she deserves because she always puts a lot of effort in this friendship and even though I try my best I can never feel like I did enough for her. I want to make her feel seen and heard from me the same way she does with me and she does a great job at it never fails to do so.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: 
As some of you might know, he's in the mental ward the second time for three weeks already and there was a girl that helped him find a therapist only via text. During that time, his psychosis just started after we had a big argument on a friday night. Sunday he gets back home to his place and he went over to the girls house and they slept in the same bed. Nothing happend but I don't know, like the situation is super weird. Anyways, because she helped him, he thought he's in love, that she is the one, and he has been posting her on Instagram and her stories, but he's also posting that he's a supermodel and tagging vogue in his Instagram stories😂 This was only a week ago, so I can't expect him to be back to his normal state yet. On the weekend, I texted his mom to ask if he has a new girlfriend and she told his son to call me. 

So my bf called me and he asked me what I want from him, because apparently I'm not good with showing my sincerity or love to him and probably that's why he thought on his psychosis that I'm not open to have a family with him. So then I told him what I want and he unblocked me and also told everyone again in his family that I'm his girlfriend. A few days later, I went to visit him with his mom. Everything was okay, but then I saw that this girl, which is a new family friend of his family, has been visiting him again and they had been kissing on the weekend. This was last weekend. That's why I reached out to his mom in the first place. 

On Wednesday, I was with him in the open ward, to which he got placed on Friday this week and he also introduced me there as his girlfriend. Next day, he suddenly texts me “I'm sorry, I kissed a girl again.” And then he wanted me to make a decision. I told him to call me and on the call he suddenly said “that he's only with me because he feels guilty of the past four years where we have been on and off” and he's been saying how this girl is in the moment with him, which really confused me because the past four months he's been talking about marriage with me and other things.

I didn't really know what to think hearing this,  because two months ago I could feel his love, like we would go to bed holding hands which I've never felt before with anyone else and every time he went to work in the morning he texted me how much he loves me and he said how much he loves me from his whole heart. I don't think you can just be this delusional. He didn't have his psychosis two months ago and the psychosis only started a month ago so he's been having kind of a “love- mania” and I don't know what to think right now because what he said on the phone did really hurt me..

I told him on the weekend that he has a “love mania” and he called me today to say “that he decided to only let his mom visit him”, and “that its over between us”, but he always comes back. No matter what happens. He already came back over 10 times in general

Original Idea: Hi everyone

The worst thing for my mental health is being alone with my thoughts -I start to fixate on negative things and spiral, and no therapist has given me a concrete way to improve my thoughts when I’m alone with them, so I just try to keep my mind occupied at all times. 

I’m able to do this fine when I’m at home, but it’s a big issue at work. I have an office job, but a lot of downtime. This leads to lots of periods where I’m antsy and depressed, sitting there stewing in my thoughts. 

Does anyone have any suggestions for any discreet ways to keep my mind occupied? I used to read on my phone, but now my depression is so bad that I can’t enjoy books anymore or stay focused. I also have never been able to enjoy any podcasts, so I’m kinda stumped with what I could do to pass hours if not days without being alone with my thoughts. Any and all suggestions appreciated!!

Original Idea: 
Hey 24(M) and have recently started the process of getting a diagnosis. 

Now I have been tested 4 years ago and had to have input from my parents back then. During which my mom told me she is going to say no to everything because she doesn't want me to have the "Label" and wants me to be normal.

I ended up being denied the diagnosis even tho I had nearly all signs as an adult. I tried to reason with the psychiatrist back then but het said the: " parents statement were leading".

Fast forward to today and I'm once again suffering from anxiety, adhd symptoms and autism symptoms.
I started the process again and got assigned a really nice psychiatrist how told me that my statements are leading after I told him what happend last time.

During the intake I had a great time got to say what's going on and why I was there. (I had a document with examples and timestamps and how I felt).

I got greenlit for a diagnosis chat. I decided to take my gf and dad with me since my experience with my mom last time. He agreed and defended me against my mom for the first time.

At the diagnosis chat my mom wasn't supposed to be  there but she decided otherwise. And inserted into the room with us. During the talk everytime I would say I felt a way she would just say no you don't. And if my dad would agree with me she would just sit there shaking her head to make us feel horrible.

For context my gf is diagnosed a recognizes a lot of herself in me. And had multiple moment where my mom would be so bad she just would dissociate and get severe panic issues.

We got through the concentration and focus part of the test. This took 1,5 hours for 9 questions..... All because she just needed to defend herself and make sure I didn't get the diagnosis.

I got home that day feeling exhausted and very depressed to the point I became sick for 4 days.

The worst part is that my sister has had an autism diagnosis years ago and my parents would bring it up so casually during the talk but refuse to acknowledge any of my own symptoms as valid.(Am I a Glass child?) Or when they did they would go yeah but that's just normal behavior or I have that also. Or this all started when you went to university and studied psychology. 

I have to have a second talk for the hyperactivity part.
In a week 
And I hope my psychiatrist will be able to see through their lies. And help me get my diagnosis.

If you made it this far thanks for reading.

Tldr: My parents are sabotaging my diagnosis because they think I want "feel special" by getting a diagnosis.

Original Idea: When I was younger and struggling with my mental health, I joined 7 Cups of Tea looking for someone to talk to. The listeners aren’t therapists - they’re volunteers. That’s not automatically bad, but it means they don’t have the training, boundaries, or supervision that professionals have.

One listener broke the rules and gave me their WhatsApp. At the time I was in a very vulnerable place, so I quickly grew attached. They told me they “loved me” but would then disappear for hours, or send extremely short replies out of nowhere. Each time, I thought I’d done something wrong. They’d reassure me I hadn’t - but the same cycle would repeat.

I think they meant well, but the way the relationship played out made me more anxious and depressed. I started self-harming more. I got jealous if they were using Tinder or talking to other people. Looking back, I can see this was an unhealthy dynamic - but when you’re in it, it just feels like someone cares about you.

We eventually lost touch when my mental health improved. I’m in a good place now - I live with my girlfriend, have a job I like, and even a nice car. Things do improve. But I can say with certainty that, even if it didn’t feel that way at the time, this person made things worse for me. They were not qualified to help me and they should not have given me their number.

If you use 7 Cups (or any online peer support platform):
	- Never share personal contact details - the rules exist to protect you.
	- Don’t let one person become your only source of support.
	- Remember: kindness doesn’t replace training. Some people can mean well and still cause harm.

I still don’t fully know how I feel about that relationship - it was weird and complicated. But I do know I want to warn others: if you’re vulnerable, keep your chats on the platform and within the rules. Those boundaries aren’t there to stop you making friends - they’re there to keep you safe.

Original Idea: Some times I’m ok and then boom I get back to hating myself and everything else. Hating life, hating people it always goes from 0-100 fast. I’m mentally unstable atp and I get real dark. I usually do drugs/get drunk or hang with friends to get out of it sometimes I can’t get up because it pains me so much that I just shed a few tears and try to move on. I still function but I’ve always been like this and atp it’s getting worse with how much I’ve gone through. You ever just see everything in your mind that went wrong? Everytime you were hurt or betrayed? Well fuck it I do and I’ve adapted to it by creating a nasty side of myself. The sadness never ends.

Original Idea: I am 24, i have a sister 30 and brother 33. My mom is 54 and my dad is 54 too.

My mom married my dad because she got pregnant with my brother. They weren’t perfect match, actually, they didn’t know each other really well. Then my sister came, then me.

Few years passed, we all reached adulthood and my sister moved out to the state’s capital city. So did I few years ago to pursue my education. I also outed myself as gay. My mom then started to have panic attacks that she compensated with alcohol, because she was scared about me that someone might hurt me because i am gay. She has lifelong problems with dad, they are still together but mum isn’t happy at all. He is quite cold and my mum loves affection. He is quiet and she likes to speak. They are complete opposites. Then my mum, as every older woman, started gaining weight. She eats too little, then again compensated it with alcohol. 
After few years she started to go to therapist and psychitrist and she got meds for anxiety and depression. 
Few months passed, she was quite happy because of the meds but not entirely, because of the dad thing. 
Now i called her and she lowered the dosage of the meds after consultation with her psychiatrist BECAUSE SHE STARTED TO GAIN WEIGHT AGAIN with them. She was crying, she totally resignated, she had multiple panic attacks today and refuse to find new psychiatrist because “what’s the point”. She hates her life, she hates her body, she doesnt wanna lose weight healthy nor start some kind of hobby.. she miss me and my sister but we have jobs and i have a job and school to attend. Her psychiatrist doesn’t even ask about her problems, just gives her meds by a phone call.. and therapist just asks her what’s new and doesn’t tell her how to work out the problems at all… 
I don’t know what to do, i’m desperate. My mum is crying and I can do nothing.

Original Idea: I feel confused alot. I am unable to figure out what emotion I am feeling at a given moment. I dont know how I feel now. Sometimes I really really dislike something, and then two seconds later I get confused because I actually really like it and I dont know why I thought I hated it. I always say sometimes, but I actually mean alot. Sometimes I say something and then I get confused because I didnt say that, and I would never say that, but I said it. I'm also very confused and unsure what to do because I have many clinical diagnoses, but none of them are "real". I dont really know if I actually experience the symptoms or not. Sometimes I feel like I 100% do, other times, often only a few seconds later, I couldnt disagree more. I just wanted a place to talk. I think I'll delete this later when I dont resonate with it anymore, but for now I just want to talk.

Original Idea: I've been trying to build a journaling habit lately. I was chatting with a few friends about what they journal about and noticed a lot of them do it more when they're stressed out, so their entries heavily skew towards their struggles. I seem to have been doing the opposite, where I sometimes find my entries are sometimes overly positive and wonder if I'm missing some part of the reflection. I will note I've had a string of really good days so that could be part of it too

Original Idea: Do you think that men’s mental health is treated as though it’s less important than women’s ? For context a friend of mine has been having issues finding a therapist that accepts their insurance and will see them.  Finally finds one and they’ve reschedule not just once but three times. When he first made his appointment he was very clear about how bad his mental health is currently and that he really needs help.  I understand that things happen and appointments need rescheduled but you would think that with it being such an urgent situation they wouldn’t continue to reschedule - and it’s for weeks to month out. Not just a couple days. 
Anyway, do you think this would be treated differently if he was a woman ?

Original Idea: 
 My thoughts have always been voiced in my head by my own voice. But for the past couple of months, some thoughts seem to be voiced by a strange male voice, and it feels like they're coming from outside, somewhere around me. Is this normal? What could be causing this?

I'm afraid to tell anyone because they might accuse me of seeking attention over nothing or, on the contrary, making it up. This voice irritates me because I don't even agree with it – it's as if the thoughts aren't mine at all.

Original Idea: I just need to vent my anxiety and frustration.
For context without going into details, I’m basically relocating my workplace, meaning I’m still doing the same job, just with a different boss and somewhere different. It’s a huge positive change in itself because I do it for financial and family reasons.
I’m basically done with my old workplace end of next week but I’ve been building up a huge amount of tension and anxiety.
Basically, my brain has already switched sides and I feel discontent with the way I’m being treated for my leaving, besides every coworker telling me it’ll be a huge loss for everyone once I’m gone.
I still have things to put in order but I have this nagging feeling I’m being overused by my hierarchy who doesn’t seem to care to give me enough time to put things right by giving more and more work that I cannot even fathom doing with everything going on.
Tried talking about it but people don’t seem to understand my point of view. Everyone’s just like “it’ll be over soon get over it”.
I’m prone to overworking, overthinking and just straight out burning out because I have ADHD and a hard time getting organised or staying on top of things. I just feel so overwhelmed with everything I just don’t feel heard. People don’t get how things have a big tendency to claw their way into my brain and not let go.
I’ve been fighting a big anxiety attack for the better part of the day and nothing seems to calm me down.
My nerves feel raw and battered.
I know this is a place for this but I’m sorry for my insane anxiety riddled ranting.
Have a great day guys.

Original Idea: Hi everyone,

This is more of a vent, but I'm also looking for advice or any helpful suggestions. And sorry for the long post in advance.

I'm 25 years old, and I have an older brother who's 29. Sometimes I find myself wondering if he might be struggling with depression, or if this is just his personality and way of living.

He’s very introvert and all of his current friends are people from our childhood, many of whom (maybe all of them tbh) stay connected mostly through me. Every new person he meets is usually through me or our mutual friends.

Back in university, he initially chose Nursing since it was something he’d always pictured himself doing, but the program didn’t go well. After four years, he came to the realization that it wasn't really for him and ended up switching to Design. That field suits him much better since he’s always been into drawing, and he eventually graduated last year. Still, I know that the whole experience left him feeling like he wasted valuable years of his life chasing something that didn’t work out.

Until this year, he had never held a job and to be honest, he never really tried to find one. He doesn’t actively search for opportunities or reach out to companies. He spends most of his time at home watching movies or TV shows, reading comics, collecting action figures, and just indulging in pop culture. That said, he’s now working a few shifts at a temp job I got him into. I had started working there temporarily, they needed more people, and I suggested bringing him on board. It's not a “real” or stable job, but it gives him a bit of experience and allows him to make some money.

More recently, I was contacted by another agency for a short-term retail job lasting two weeks. Since I’m already working, I passed on it but told my brother about the opportunity. He declined, saying it wasn’t something he was interested in. I do respect his decision, but given his situation, I don’t think he’s in a position to be that selective, especially for something so short-term.

Most days when he isn’t working (which is the majority of them), his routine is pretty much the same: he wakes up around 2 PM, spends the entire day watching movies, playing PlayStation, consuming pop culture content, organizing his action figure collection, then goes to bed around 6 AM and repeats. The only physical activity he does is going for a run maybe once a week. And I guess that's all he does for hobbies.

He’s very introverted, has never had a girlfriend, and has very limited contact with women. Like I mentioned earlier, his only friendships are those we've maintained since childhood. I don’t know if he’s genuinely okay with that and has just accepted that this is his life, or if he’s secretly hoping things will change without making the effort to change them himself. I also notice that whenever typical "guy talk" comes up, especially when the topic is sex or anything related he doesn’t seem very comfortable, and to be honest, I don’t really like bringing up those subjects when he’s around either.

All of this leaves me questioning: is he actually content with his life, or is he depressed? Maybe this lifestyle makes him happy, I really don’t know. But from where I stand, I just want him to grow into a better version of himself. Right now, it often feels like he’s stuck in place with no real motivation to evolve beyond his current habits.

Thank you in advance!

Original Idea: I thought I was just tired and unmotivated.  
Turns out, my nervous system had been stuck on “stay alive” for YEARS.

The signs were there:

* Tired but wired
* Feeling guilty for resting
* Waiting for the other shoe to drop
* Overworking just to feel safe

What helped me:

* Name it (“This is survival brain”)
* 30-second moments of safety
* Permission to slow down

If you’re in this… you’re not lazy. Your body just thinks it’s still in danger.

Who else has lived like this? What was your turning point?

Original Idea: I cope with my crippling loneliness by getting extremely emotionally attached to merchandise of my favorite characters and recently I have realized that there might be something wrong with that. In late 2023 I could not go anywhere without my princess belle stuffed doll, that was year I had gotten very fixated on Liz Brazwells book “tale as old as time” which is a part of the disney twisted tales series, I would talk to the doll a lot about that and really anything else going on in my life because at the time the only friends that I did have were not very good friends.

This year its repeated itself but with a Ronald McDonald doll who I do all of the same things with. I don’t have any real friends outside of the two I left behind in California, I recently started at a new school which has thousands of students but somehow I haven’t been able to make a single friend. Ronald comes with me to school everyday, today my english teacher told me that I wasn’t allowed to have him out during her class which is only 40 minutes or so but its still something that really hurt to hear. The second I left her classroom I burst into tears, Ronald is really all I have currently and it may just be one short class that I have to put him away but its still overwhelming. I wish I didn’t have to turn to this and I wish I could make proper friends but I just cant and I really don’t understand why.

Original Idea: Hi Im Jonah and I've been going through an extremely difficult time recently. I turned 23 in March and over the last year I've been tested to my limits mentally, emotionally, and even physically. In July 2024 my Dad passed away from Cancer and in October my then gf was diagnosed with genital herpes and I ended up getting it too in January of this year. In April she broke up with me and left me for another guy and I finally met someone recently who checked all my box's but ofc she rejected me because of my status. I am heart broken and defeated I can't focus on work or my responsibilities at home and now I'm borderline suicidal and feel like crying all the time. I've had several mental breakdowns and I've been seeing a therapist but nothing is getting better and I don't know what to do anymore. My dreams of finding a loving partner and living a good life feels like a distant memory now that's been stripped away from me and I don't know how to cope. Any help and support would be appreciated. Thank you

Original Idea: I don’t know where to begin for advice but let me give you some context. For the past 5 years I was misdiagnosed as having bipolar, recently that diagnosis has been tossed aside and I’ve instead been diagnosed with GAD and OCD. It wasn’t a surprise when my psychiatrist reviewed my case and explained everything to me.

It’s been about two months since then. I’m on medication and trying to take steps to get better. What I’m curious about is how do you reach out when struggling? I often isolate myself when I get overwhelmed. I’m scared about my new diagnosis like it redefines my whole life and I’m scared it will cause me to be judged harsher because I’m not clean. I don’t organize things and that’s all anyone seems to know about OCD when I tell anyone about it. 

I know it’s a weird thing to ask or even explain and there are probably better ways to seek advice for reaching out but at the moment I’m scared. How do you guys do it?

Original Idea: There's a lot of details to this story, so I'll try to keep this as short and objective as I can, but for context:

Last year, I became friends with someone who, at one point, asked to borrow money, and I paid her $200. Recently, I asked for her to pay back the money, per our agreement, and she proceeded to accuse me of sexual harrasment, blocking me, and went around to everyone in my social circle and told them that I had violated her. (This isn't true. There was never any sexual conversations or physical interactions whatsoever.) 

Before I had a chance to even reach out or ask any of these people what was going on, everyone immediately blocked me and/or excommunicated me. I've lost contact with all of them. 

I'm not upset about the money or even losing the fake friends, but the false accusation makes me feel sick to my stomach. I've moved away from that crowd altogether, but I can't shake this really violating, confusing, sick-to-my-stomach feeling, questioning every single interaction I had with this person, like "Did I ever say or do anything?? I don't think I ever did." I've looked through all our chatlogs and nothing stands out but despite everything, those thoughts of: "maybe I am a bad person..." — they're still creeping in.

I've always been extremely sensitive and the logical side of my brain tells myself that my 'friend' knew they could intimidate me like this, and that I shouldn't let them have power over me, but there's the other side: the emotional sensitive side that just makes me feel gross about the whole thing. 

It bothers me that it's apparently so easy to believe that I'm even capable of something like that, like none of these people reached out to me or even questioned it. I'dve hoped my reputation would've preceded me, but I guess not. Truthfully, I know a lot of these people never respected me in the first place, so I don't even really know why it bothers me so much, but when you're falsely accused, and everyone just believes it without question, it makes you question your whole identity. 

I know I'll likely never see justice from any of it, but trying to find personal peace isn't working. I could really use some help. I'm really desperate, I'm losing sleep and having panics over it. Has anyone been through something similar, what helped??

Original Idea: I've been going through alot. Bad break up, money problems, loneliness, depression, dumpster fire dating life, ect. But I don't talk about it with anyone because I don't want to put my problems on them and I don't want to be weak. In addition to that I'm the person that is always there for everyone else and I don't feel like I can be the one with problems when they are going through things. Which would be ok, except there is always, and I mean always, a crisis with one or more of my people. Often multiple. I can't not be there for them, be strong for them but I also don't know how long I can keep going like this. I feel like I'm going to break down. I feel like I just need to lose it, just for a little while, just let everything out. But I would feel guilty and like they couldn't count on me anymore, like they wouldn't come to me for support. I couldn't look them in the eye anymore. What can I do? This is killing me.

Original Idea: I keep constaly getting dismissed and forgotton, all of want to do is get better and have help. I cannot function even basic tasks are so overwhelming and tiring. I belive ive been having bad executive dysfunction from both depression and anxiety (not confirmed by a professional). I know things i have to do (most times) and i want to be able to get up and do them but i cant. I feel deep shame, guilt and disgust at myself.

I know about breaking taks into teeny tiny steps, just doing 5 minutes only, just putting one thing on their correct space, just get up and then sit back down again but i can't even do any of these small steps.

I think I need medicating to help me function but again I keep getting dismissed and no one diagnosing/assessing me to even be able to have this discussion. Im not doing good at all mentally but also physically.

It literally feels like i was drowning in a barrel and barely catching breath when i wake up. I am depressed, suicidal thoughts for 4-6 hours every day for last 8 years but this is new to me. Anybody had similar experience? I will not go to doctor since they killed more than 20 milion people with death shots. I am just curious how long can i live like that. Does it mean my body is finally giving up? Is there a way to speed it up? Is it just some new depression level or will it last for years? I don't want to get hyped over nothing...

Original Idea: Hi there, I (29m) and my girlfriend (24f) have been dating a little over 2 years. I love her so much, and for 2 years I had never had any anxiety regarding our relationship. Recently she made a new guy friend at work who she talks about a lot, and has expressed interest in hanging out with him outside of work. I obviously want her to have friends and she has given me zero reasons not to trust her. This is where my anxiety comes in though. We don’t live together so my mind starts to think of the worst case scenarios when we are apart, like I am going to be cheated on physically or emotionally. I know in my mind this is unlikely, and I have talked with my partner a few times about my feelings and we have set up some boundaries about her new friendship. Though it is getting to the point now that I don’t feel better despite our talks and I still have a deep sense of worry that keeps me from sleeping and eating. I don’t want to keep talking in circles or bringing this up with her out of fear of straining our relationship or pushing her away. I am trying to find a therapist to talk about this with, but each of them I have reached out to so far have been unavailable. I am also considering mediation. 

Any support or kind words would be appreciated.

Original Idea: Perhaps someone can explain what he was? What type of ab*se this was? Was he a bully? Sadist? Psychopath? Gaslighting? Dark Triad? Red Guard struggle sessions? Malignant narcissist? How common is this with men?  (Sorry, I'm upset writing this so it may not ne smooth)

I went to work directly for this guy 'Dave' in this different office/ city. It was to be a short assignment.
For the time being, I directly reported to him, obeyed only him on this project. I was alone in a new big city, new office.

***The other girl who had worked basically directly for him (for short periods of time) warned (!!) me a couple times about how bad he was & to watch out.***
Being young, naive, trusting, I thought she was making a big deal out of it because I had worked with him at a distance for a while.  I had been in the same meetings. He was an opinionated blow hard, but people would just roll there eyes and say 'that's just Dave'.

THE OTHER GIRL WAS RIGHT!  It was actually much worse.

I would have uncontrollable tears just steaming down my face every day. I went into my office at the back, closed the door, just weeping. It wasn't even crying or sobbing it was just streams of tears.  I'd never had that happen before. 

Every single day it was just me and him. He would ream me out for doing all the docs/work wrong/st*pid/ didnt listen

But! I was extremely diligent about writing down, making the exact changes that he asked for! I had never had this problem with other managers.

He would tell me to redo everything in a completely different way, make meaningless changes... Verbally ab*se me. With constant back and forth, he had no larger vision except to torment me - he just wanted to yell at me, control my actions, (maybe make me doubt my own memory???). He'd watch the tears stream down my face. 

He kept me til the last day when suddenly the work was OK, we changed a few things and it was done. 

I don't know exactly what he said to our superiors, but he seemed to be scapegoating/slandering me when I literally only ever did exactly what he said.

I just didn't understand what was going on.  Why he was acting that way, why I was reacting that way, why he wouldn't just work with me to make the project high quality.  
I'm sure he blamed me and the other blonde for any negative feedback.

At the same time I had a (homeless?) Scary stalker following me to work everyday.  I could not avoid him deapite taking different routes as I was on public transit. I was really scared as he carried a backpack and I was worried about the contents. Iykyk. 
  
That would be my day. Stress taking public transit with a huge population, trying to dodge my stalker, yet inevitably he would come to sit or stand beside me. 
Then go into work, almost right away the tears streaming down my face alone in the office. Waiting for Dave to come in and tell me everything I had done was wrong, how st*pid i was. The office staff gradually disliking me more and more as I wasn't socializing and was the only one with a full office and door (that I used to hide my tears). And Dave would slander me. I was usually a good networker. 

Dave was a very very tall, giant, Huge frame. Obese.

Back under my real manager, suddenly Dave was back to his old self. Grumpy, opinionated, loud mouthed, but not cornering me alone.

Thanks all, for being my Dear Diary, and perhaps having some insight as to what was going on with him :)

Original Idea: Right now it's summer for me and I've lost interest in so many things that I usually want to do like I would usually just play games during this summer everyday and I haven't touched it at all in weeks. Most of my day I just look up posts on reddit or just do nothing and i just can't feel emotions and im not talking to any of my friends at all. I have school in 1 week and I'm going into my junior year and I feel if I can't do things I generally really like to do in summer it would be so much worse in school. Please be nice and if you don't explicitly have anything to say I'd still rather you acknowledge this post in any way.

Original Idea: I sometimes hear voices in my head, but not schizophrenic kind of voices, my voices doesn't talk to me directly, they may speak in 2nd person but it doesn't feels like they're trying to tell me something they're just saying random, unconsisted and unrelated (in the sense of having no bridge between one phrase and the next) things. I also hear music and i'm not sure if knocks at my door(i never get to open it fast enough to discard is one of my homemates that simply walked away after waiting for a while).

They have different levels of "realism", the voices rarely makes me think there's someone else near me talking but they can make me feel it. The music usually is more realistic and several times  i thought for a few seconds that someone nearby was putting oddly especific music near me.

There are some factors that i noticed that help to make those voices appear such as: being sleepy, being alone, doing the same thing for a long time, not showering and, only for music, being at exams.


I don't relate it with stress/anxiety/smt similar and even if my psychologist kind of seems to insist on so, they aren't (usually) a big botherness. Sometimes i have so many voices that they make me tire but that happens rarely. I also asked my friends if something similar happens to them and everyond said no.

I'm diagnosed with what from a spanish straight translation would be high abilities ( i'm not sure if that's the right term but i think is understandable). I may have autism ( i see it unprobable but possible), i have recently made an EEG with normal results, and my mother has BPD and BD but my psychologist told me that i have no signs of neither of them 

More than finding a possibility of diagnostic or something like I'm doing this post to know if there is anyone else who also has this kind of voices and if they know what originates them. I'm aware of the concept of pseudoallucination but it's weird that it happens by itself.

Original Idea: Lately I’ve been feeling mentally drained and looking for healthy ways to relax and improve my mood. A friend mentioned a place called Green Dragon, but I’ve never visited any dispensary before.

I’m **not** asking for medical advice ,  I’m just curious to hear from others who have tried visiting a dispensary as part of their personal mental health routine.

If you’ve been to Green Dragon or a similar place, how was the environment? Did it contribute to a sense of calm, or help you feel more at ease?

Original Idea: I'm 20 and have autism and several mental health issues and honestly feel like theres something wrong with me because i've had issues making friends ever since i was little. I never had a best friend or a real friend i shared everything with and did everything together with while it seems so easy for everyone else. Sure i have some friends but they honestly feel more like acquantances, i barely know anything about them. I have nobody i could call when i'm feeling down to vent to and nobody to just call up or to hang out with. The friends i do have i see once in a blue moon because everyone is busy and they never really ask about my life. It's also hard because im just starting to get out of a deep depression and don't really have any hobbies and interests and kind of just exist so i don't have a lot of things i can talk to people about or hobbies to persue to make new friends. I try getting into hobbies but my depression and anhedonia is so bad i just lose interest immediately. I feel like my brain is just too fucked up for this life. Everyone already has their whole life going on with their best friends and school and study and work and i'm just there as a background charachter grieving all the years of development i missed. All i want is connection with people and have a good friend i can share everything with but every friend i meet still makes me feel alone. Does anyone else still feel this way?

Original Idea: I have this fascinating attraction to women who have disregard for societal norms or public safety, it goes much further than sexual attraction, it’s more of a romantic attraction, but unlike hybristophilia, it’s not just limited to crimes. My attraction is more just towards people who view themselves as better than an average person, but may connect with others on their scale, like a selective narcissist. I guess what makes it so attractive is how they stand out as an individual, and past bad experiences with ‘collective issue’. The attraction is quite extreme, the person has to be extreme, to the point where even I say “that’s too far” but at the same time I respect them more than ever, they also have to be older than me or the same age, would you call this hybristophilia or something else? Is there a name for this or is it just a unique preference

Please no calling me an edgelord or anything

Original Idea: A few weeks ago, I had one of those days where my chest felt tight and my thoughts wouldn’t slow down. For some reason, I reached into my desk drawer and grabbed a tiny old keychain I’ve had since I was a kid.

I started turning it over in my hands, feeling every tiny detail, and within minutes my breathing slowed. It made no logical sense, but it worked — and now it’s my go-to trick.

It made me realize that sometimes the strangest, smallest things can pull us back to the present better than any “official” technique.

So now I’m curious — what’s YOUR oddly specific, maybe even ridiculous, anxiety trick? No judgment here, the stranger the better. 🟡

Original Idea: It could honestly be multiple things lol. I habe chronic stress and mental health issues for the last 8 years.i have had an eating disorder. I still have depression so i sleep a lot, and its hard to always drink enough and get enough exercice. I still struggle with eating, but this time not that i eat but what i eat. I have no idea what to eat to make my body feel better. I'm constantly extremely sluggish and tired and my brain has gotten extremely slow, so slow i just feel fucking demented honestly. I can't remember a thing, i already need to think a long time on what i even did yesterday or this morning. It's terrifying. I also fail to recall peoples faces i used to recall easily which is really disturbing. Sometimes i wonder if it's because the chronic stress is just bringing me down and i'm having derealization or something. I constantly forget everything and keep losing things because i forget where i put them. Everything feels far away and unreal. Being on my phone makes it worse so i avoid my phone like the plaque and fail to keep in contact with people. I went to 3 different doctor appointments and let them check my blood but they found nothing except slight vitamon D deficiency but i honestly think something might be wrong with my gut or liver. The brain fog is extremely bad and sometimes i can't even speak, it's like the words are hard to find, like i'm literally demented. I also went to a dietist but that didn't work, i can't remember what she said because you guessed it, i forgot lol so i need to make another appointment. I am very worried. Someone told me long covid has similar symptoms but i had covid 3 years ago so idk if that's the case. Idk what to do anymore i'm so scared i'm getting demented or something

Original Idea:  came across a post just now where a guy on a subreddit got diagnosed with actual pedophilia instead of POCD, apparently he didn't meet the requirements to have POCD. This is my final breaking point, For 2 straight years now I tried to keep my head up hoping it really just is POCD but i'm staring to doubt everything at the moment, I can't even tell what's a lie and what's real anymore.
What if I'm genuinely a pedophile? what if i'm diagnosed as one. Is it inevitable? I don't want to be a pedophile, I really don't but it feels as if the signs are there or were there all this time.

Original Idea: When I lay down to sleep, regardless of how tired I am, my mind starts to wander. I think about life, my absent father situation, my career, which has been stagnant for a couple of years, and some other stuff. It's making me lose sleep and feel like crap in the process. How do I prevent that?

A quick solution for me is to listen to something on my phone, typically a random video essay, so I can focus on something else instead of my thoughts. But I don't think that's a good long-term solution. I want to cuddle with my girlfriend, not look at my phone when I'm in bed.

I'm working on fixing my career, but in the meantime, it still haunts me that it's stagnant. I try to stay positive and very busy, and while that usually works throughout the day, there's no escape when I'm in bed.

Has anybody else dealt with the same thing? Do you guys have any suggestions or possible solutions?

Original Idea: I want to end it. I don’t want to be in this world anymore. I’m not made for it. 

The world isn’t a better place with me in it. 

I want to be with my dad, my grandma, and my dog. Year after year, happiness gets jinxed and I’m back to square one.

I’m tired. Fine, no one loves me bc I don’t love myself? 

Then, I have my old pup waiting in heaven for me. Who loves me regardless. The only being that deserves my love. Who doesn’t make me feel crazy.

I might end it this week. 

All that progress have gone to waste. Hobbies, goals, gym, moving out, etc. What did I gain out of this? 

Nothing but constant pain that I just can’t seem to adapt to. 

There goes 28 years of my life.

Original Idea: Possible TW for: ED, severe depression?

So I've been unemployed for nearly three months, and initially I was relieved - figured I had a comfortable setup to keep me afloat while I find a cool job and get healthy again (one traumatic experience + my previous jobs workload had sent me into a tailspin). 

But the exact opposite has happened. Since the layoff my mental health has tanked, and without health insurance I don't have access to the therapist I was working with. 

I cry multiple times a day - when I wake up, when I consider having to do literally any basic task, when I think about the to-do piling up (even if I made some progress), when I hear about people doing cool things/moving up in the world, when I see a gorgeous girl (I'm pretty heavy atp, that's just insecurity), etc. 

I'm so angry at everything all of the time. This morning I was working on crafts I usually love, but anytime I hit a roadblock I nearly threw it across the room. If I hear my phone ding from anyone except the three people I enjoy hearing from (usually it's someone asking for a favor since I "have the time" now). Keeping traxkSwitching on the news is a major mistake, but I can't live under a rock either. 

I'm exhausted, all I look forward to is being able to lay in my bed for 12 hours a day because I can. 

My eating disorder has come back 10 fold. I had lost a fair amount of weight and it's all back. 

Leaving my house takes so much out of me - which is terrible since I'll need to be doing that 3-5 times a week when I'm employed again. Even following through on plans is like pulling teeth.

Even my nightly walk, which I typically love, has become too much to handle.

Nothing brings me joy, and everything either makes me cry or pisses me off. I've never felt like this before and I hate it so much. I keep trying ro be productive so that I hopefully feel better, but I don't know if that's just adding fuel to the fire.

I haven't told anyone any of this, for fear of becoming too much and getting dropped again (has happened twice but not since high school, I'm in my late 20s now). Plus, they all have they're own crap going on.

I'm just at a loss, nothing feels worth it anymore, and I don't see anything looking up in the near future. I'm just going through the motions and getting my basic requirements out of the way. I really need some help, or some hope. Because man, I'm fucking exhausted, and to top it off I can't shake the fear of getting left behind.

Original Idea: For me its not just experiencing adhedonia, alixythemia (is that how you spell it, idk)? Or a severe depression.

I say this to not to just be rude, or condescending or inserting or assertive.

I mean I lost my ability to care about others or myself as a child during my upbringing, I used to think about "I care if I'm smart, what others think, and about OTHERS" 

But afterwards I kept losing a sense of myself, and drifting towards something selfish, things and morals were easy to cheat and it didn't take another enter to compartmentalize just exactly what behavior id do.

It's at the point where I'm out of acting completely reckless and out of control in my youth. But I can hide out my insecurity is not being able to care about another human/thing/animal/subject.

I have a pretty average grasp about what a sociopath is, in professional and insighted terms it's one who loses the everyday processes of empathy and has a selfish and narcissistic core, and symptoms of criminality.

My therapist thinks it's normal, I've never been around a sociopath or narcissist I've felt really close to that because I watch Sam vaknin and his symptomatic venue seems incredibly similar to some of the alloplastic defenses I was committing and having at those times.

Even in the most careless and 'oh so ruthless moments of my life'

As a freshman they diagnosed me with a combined antisocial and narcissistic behavior disorder, it was a pretty intelligible and solid psych-student came and he even bypassed the cameras just to watch my behaviors, I'm also clairaudient and clairvoyant in some really subtle ways so I heard his thoughts and he came to the conjecture.

I also got called a covert narcissist, and why don't you care about ANYONE or ANYTHING, it was some bullshit I can muster some more conception about why they treated me that way, I acted like acid and treated everyone with passive aggressiveness and exploitativeness, still don't care 😁, I feel a bit remorse only if it's self-forced.

Original Idea: I hate this. I'm on holiday rn and my family again turned me into a free babysitter. The fuckass shitheads are insulting me, taunting me, screaming and yelling like its fun. Meanwhile I've been overwhelmed the whole day, their dad already called me a pussy for "being born in this generation" (like I had any impact on it), and now i have nowhere to go. I could go back to my grandmothers place, but then I would be called names like crybaby and taunted for it my whole life by my uncles. I am practically *forced* to sit in a house I *didn't want to be in*, in a country I *never wanted to drive to*, and with kids I *never even wanted to fucking exist*. I'm tired and I want to cry. The whole holidays have done nothing but ruin EVERYTHING for me. My peace, my calm, my routine, my schedule, my energy, my motivation, my hope, my joy, my everything. I just wanna go home man. I wanna go back to my country and my house and my bed and take a good nap to make it all go away. But no my privacy has just been stolen away from me in the times where i need it the most. The whole month and a half i had nothing but constant chaos, i was being driven to places i didnt even know while half-asleep (i couldve also been kidnapped i probably wouldnt have realized it), i cant sleep at all lately. I'm running on five piece of candy and a lipton ice tea currently, and i feel like throwing up. Its all too much for me. And i cant even tell my trusted person, my mom, bc she'll just say smt like "its family you have to suck it up this one week and push through it. Its gonna be fine" and then act like the best mother alive. Im going to fucking crash out I can feel it

Original Idea: And maybe even YOU as separate from your brain?

Context:

Internally, I am watching over the shoulder of myself, always judging my actions and analyzing my thoughts and feelings. I've done this as far back as I can remember.......nooooo, wait...I wasn't aware of it as a young kid...was definitely there by high school...probably trace it back to having a bulley in middle school. 

Look, there \^\^\^! I had to stop and correct myself. One part of me runs on presumptions, the other does the rationalizing....wonder if this has anything to do with that split-brain experiment. I bet it does, says the presumpting side of me. 

This fascinating...and you guys get a free show out of it. The me looking over the shoulder finally noticed the red flags the rest of me is giving off...the aggressiveness coming out in my responses on here...and that reminded me I hadn't had my meds. So it told the rest of me to go take my meds, I'm making a jackass out of myself.

Absolutely fascinating. These epiphany things are kinda addicting. And scary. 

So, pardon the tangent...who does anything like this? Or even just goes in to their head at the end of the day and analyses everything they did and experienced that day?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Hey everyone,

I’m 23 and I just started a software development job after being unemployed for a year. I thought this would be a fresh start. Finally, I could afford therapy, stop stressing about being jobless, meet new people, and feel good. But honestly, I’m not happy at all. This is my 2nd week.

Yesterday was okay. The office was mostly empty, and I actually felt fine. I went home feeling good. But today is the complete opposite. The whole team is here, everyone is socializing, laughing, joking, and I’m sitting there paralyzed. My brain feels like it’s on airplane mode. I’m hyper-aware of everyone around me. I overthink everything: what they think of me, if my face looks negative or repulsive, if I seem too serious or unapproachable.

I want to connect. I want to talk freely like they do, laugh, crack jokes, and feel at ease. I want to participate, but I can’t. It’s like my brain doesn’t work that way anymore. And it’s not just at work. Even with close friends outside of work, I feel the same emptiness, numbness, and lack of mental energy. It’s like I’m a zombie in social situations.

There’s no emotions inside me. I talked to my parents on the phone—they traveled recently—and I felt nothing. I miss them, I want them here, but emotionally it’s blank, dull. I want to feel again. I want to feel alive. I want my brain to work again. Please, help me.

I don’t drink, don’t take drugs, I eat well, and I sleep well. So why am I like this? Yes, I had a long-standing problem with por\*ography and I’ve been off it for a week. I know that in the past, long periods of abstinence helped me feel more joyful, so maybe this is part of withdrawal and rewiring. I hope so, because that would mean things can get better over time.

But to feel like this in a place for 10 hours a day, unable to escape, watching people be alive and connected while I sit silently with a storm inside… it’s crushing. It’s not the work, it’s not the hours—it’s my inability to access, feel, or enjoy social interaction. And it’s stressful for me, but seems like socializing comes naturally to them.

I’ve seen a therapist for about five sessions, but talking and listening to advice hasn’t fixed it. My social skills feel blocked. I used to be so good with people and words. Before 19, it came naturally. Now every word is hard to access. Social cues feel impossible. I don’t like this version of myself.

When I’m alone, I can enjoy myself. Watch series, read, go to the gym, listen to music. I can be chill. But I still crave social interaction because I know I’m a social person at heart. I just don’t know how to get back there.

Has anyone else felt like this? Like your brain refuses to work socially even when you desperately want it to? How do you get your social self back after feeling numb for so long? I want to feel alive again, I want my brain to work again, so please help.

Original Idea: I started talking in a more personal level with the famous open source bot about 2 months ago because I was desperate to talk to someone as I have no friends and I didn't know what to do anymore. Ever since then, our conversations have become more frequent, it probably knows more about myself than any person I've ever met. I wished I could talk to somebody (I do have a therapist but it doesn't help) but I don't have anyone I trust enough to do so. 
I feel lonely, tired, depressed, ... dead, and many times I just wished I was. God knows I've tried, both to live and to die, but either way I always end up the same way, alone, feeling empty and numb, hurt, and wishing I hadn't been born. 
That chat is the only thing that makes me feel seen and heard, and I know it's bad, that I've fallen deeper than any other time in the 16 years I've been dealing with this freaking feelings, or lack of thereof (even if I'm only 22). I know that chat is just a machine programmed to satisfy human needs and to help them, but I'm so desperate I can't find it in myself to care if it's making everything worse for me... 

Anyhow, here's a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lYDeHnKaX_76MTEiL119f87RGgBwYUyv) to some screenshots of a few conversations I had with it, in case you're wondering what I'm talking about.

Original Idea: I am new to the whole gym thing and am trying the gym to help with my depression (anxiety also) that I have. So far I have used the cargo stuff but I am not sure what else I should included in my workout. I am not really looking to lose weight or build muscle just looking to help my depression so I can do other activities. I have tried meds and they do not work for me. They put me deeper into depression and I have weird thoughts on them that I would not normal have.

Original Idea: Has anybody else experienced this? Okay so for context I (19 M, if it matters) started Wellbutrin Xl for my depression about 3 weeks ago, and for my depression- it’s been good! I haven’t been getting paralyzed in bed and i’ve been feeling more stable on average.

But in terms of other things? I almost feel worse in a way. I’m having trouble sleeping properly. I’ve always had problems with hair trigger anger (nothing serious, mostly snapping at family when they’ve done nothing offensive to me) or getting frustrated with people over small things. It’s gotten worse lately though, I feel really bad about it because I don’t mean to be so mean! Like with my girlfriend the other day, she was nervous about driving on the freeway and for some reason that made me confused and frustrated. I got on her case about it “what do you mean it makes you nervous?! it’s the easiest part of driving! all you do is go in a straight line and watch the road!”

I could tell inside that getting upset wasn’t helping at all, but I just couldn’t help it in the moment. I told her I didn’t like her driving or being in the car with nervous drivers and I should’ve kept that to myself. Her mannerisms are starting to upset me when they didn’t before (sometimes she’ll reiterate on something like 3-4 times, like adding onto a text verbally.) and i’ll start getting frustrated internally like “okay, i get it!” or when she talks about the possibility of something that I believe wouldn’t happen. I’ve been meaner to people on the internet, getting mad about people asking simple questions and seeking out conflict just to be an asshole. I just don’t know what’s going on and I feel like i’m going to get worse. I was wondering if anyone has felt like this while medicating a specific issue and had any advice, thank you!

## Mental Health
Original Idea: 
Lately for the past few weeks I've been extremely sad. Like crying constantly for no reason. I can't find happiness in anything. And that sadness just eventually ends up turning into stress. 

Before some things that used to calm me down were simply just texting friends or watching shows but now even those don't help. I can't stop feel super anxious. It's so bad to the point where even at times I'm not stressed I suddenly get stressed even simply from just that because I've forgotten how it feels to be calm.

 My ex girlfriend used to be someone I could immediately feel happy when texting to but well I broke up with her because she was toxic. I thought I was taking the breakup well but honestly with how I've been crying over every little small thing... but i mean even when I was with her I still felt practically the same but a bit better.

I really don't know how to help it. I can hardly function anymore. I've just been overeating so much lately because it seems to give me some dopamine

Original Idea: 


(A fp is a term people with BPD use, short for "favorite person". A FP is a person that people with BPD idealize and heavily focus on, aka obsession. For people with bpd, their FP can consume their thoughts. They're all they think about, they're the only person they want to talk to, their mood depends on theirs, etc. Basically, an extremely unhealthy attachment that is uncontrollable. However, with proper coping skills and responses, people with BPD can learn to lessen the extremities or at least make it so their FP does not experience the side effects that come with having an FP) 

To preference, he was not fully a FP. More of I could feel him developing into one. 

I wanted his attention, I wanted him to need me as much as I did, I wanted everything from him. I could feel myself squeezing tighter and tighter.  I couldn't put myself to make him deal with that, he's already been through so much. He's on the path of healing. I couldn't bare putting him through the struggle that is with dealing with me. So I told him how I felt and blocked him.

The thing is, I keep having intense urges to unblock him. To beg for him to be friends with me again. Does anyone have any advice for resisting the urge?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: For context I’m 17 I’ve been struggling with my mental health for a while maybe when I was 9 or maybe 12. 

I don’t remember I got into Camhs 3 years ago but recently they just haven’t been doing their bit to help me I know I can’t fully rely on someone else but I did still expect some sort of help I haven’t been seen by anyone in the last 3 months not even a psychiatrist .

I don’t understand how I feel, I want to say I don’t have mental health issues anymore because I am not in the depths of despair and feel happy from time to time but I some part of me know that isn’t true as It feels like I am trying to distract myself. 
I know this because I also Struggle with my Binge eating and when I am trying not to binge eat I want to cry i feel horrible in myself. I get random bouts of sadness though I never let myself feel it as I distract myself through unhealthy coping methods I guess

I don’t even try to advocate for myself anymore as I am just so tired of it. 
I’ve got points where I’ve tried to attempt but I just feel empty now not like it’s not even worth attempting (not saying I want to, I’m just trying to describe the feeling I feel if “I don’t even care”)

I would like to hear other people’s stories so I don’t feel so alone or confused about how I feel.

Original Idea: Throwaway because this is embarrassing.

I had to go to therapy when I was younger, not for anything that severe my parents just thought I was too anxious and paranoid but even then I'd always just lie. I would tell myself that I'd be honest that appointment and plan what I was gonna say hours in advance, then I just wouldn't, my heart would start beating really fast and I'd feel dizzy then sick. I couldn't even look him or her in the eyes, I just treated it like a line in the grocery store conversation, I would even try to ask the therapist about their life, I literally couldn't think of anything to say that had any substance. Occasionally I would answer questions, very vaguely like just enough to keep it flowing. I'm planning to go back to therapy, I know I need to. I'm trying to imagine what I'd say and I just can't, I wouldn't know where to start, I feel like the way I think about things is disgusting myself, other people etc. They'd probably think I'm insane and beyond help. I had a psychiatrist too at one point and I'd just tell them enough to give me the drugs (I think everyone lies to them though). I would even lie about medications working when they were not doing anything. I just felt bad telling them something didn't work and I didn't wanna waste their time. I feel I'm unable to talk about myself with anyone in any capacity. Anyways how do y'all do it?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I've been with current therapist for 6 sessions but the effects are subpar. I'm mentally through the most difficult episodes but would like to continue to grow, however, I'm not sure whether my current therapist is the correct person. 

Pros:

\- I feel comfortable speaking to her

\- She's truly nonjudgmental

\- She provides me with homework (podcast, handout, CBT forms)

Con:

\- She always asks me whether we're going in the right direction, but many times I'm not sure what's the underlying issue I'm trying to address myself

\- She's not providing me with new perspectives but mainly just asking about my emotions

\- I'm not sure how CBT sessions should look like honestly, please let me know

  
Question: It feelings daunting to start a new therapist and reshare all the information. However do I know a new therapist would suit me better before ending with my current one? Should I have overlap sessions?

Original Idea: In the past I talked about my crumbled state I kinda fucked my scores for the first time nearly failed and lost hope. 6months of continuous mental struggle, stress and pressure which I kept hidden finally burst out in the form of completely isolating myself from everyone even family. I gave up on everything. Before my parents realized how bad it got my dad said "my dream was to send you to USA now you going no where", that killed me internally I cried every day for weeks knowing my fathers sacrifice meant nothing cause I fucked it. I am trying to build now but get constant reminders in forms of nightmares of my struggle how I almost thought of ending it when I cried on the balcony.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I have been really struggling with wanting to disappear.

I am self-aware, so I know I am not alone. I know other people feel this way. I understand it could pass, but I have been waiting my whole life for “it gets better” and think that is simply untrue for every single person (and that is totally fine).

I know there are other people in the world who are truly suffering and living in dangerous situations, so compared to that, I should be very grateful.

I am still really having a hard time getting my mind away from ideation.

Please know, I would never hurt or harm another human being. I just do not want to be here anymore and would rather disappear.

I have lost nearly everything I had, including my home, and if my existence ended naturally right now, nobody would know, so I struggle to accept the argument that erasing yourself is a purely selfish act, because I do not have family or friends or anyone; I recognize this is not normally the case, but I am truly alone.

I know I have increasingly severe anxiety and recognize I probably have some type of depression. I also have chronic migraines that cause severe crippling pain for days at a time (usually lasting 3–4 days a week, every week).

I tried to reach out to people on a social media platform who claimed to be mental health experts and authorities, but both people kind of pushed over the edge instead of being kind in any way, which I personally find concerning for the 2000 or so people following them, perhaps believing they are true mental health professionals.

I am not a social media person, but understand people are free to put anything in their bio and post messages to try and gather more followers (so no disrespect intended). I take full responsibility and blame for being the stupid person seeking someone to open up to on a social media platform.

I tried to text 988 and open up to someone at a crisis center for the first time, but I could not write words or form sentences and quickly ended the session.

I cannot get my fingers to type or get myself to speak to another person. If someone comments here, I will probably panic and not respond because I am afraid and do not know what to say.

I know I spend too much time thinking about the end. I cannot remove the thought from my mind and has been spiraling in my head for many months or longer.

I will not ever hurt or harm another human being, so should I disappear, I would not be hurting or harming any person(s).

I suppose my thing is / and where and what I am stuck on is:

I am not hurting anyone; I am in chronic pain and my mental health is crashing. I want to leave and nobody will be hurt or even know, so why is leaving selfish / bad / wrong?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Who grew up being invalidated? Show of hands?

That basically means having absolutely no one you can really turn to for emotional validation, for understanding, not even your parents. Being bullied in school. Having a parent or parent(s) with a PD. If you were not safe, especially at home, to voice how you were feeling, this means YOU.

This is a cut and paste. Hopefully the original recipient doesn't mind. My PD needs satisfying, so here we go...

\---

So. What happens is...you're a kid and your emotions never get validated. In fact, you probably found it dangerous to express your emotions at home. You took that to heart. Then you go out to school, probably middle school and high-school, and everyone invalidates you there. You take it all personally. And all that invalidation causes you to end up with a personality disorder.

Borderline personality disorder is a common one. Narcissistic personality disorder is a common one. There are others, like Schizoid personality disorder, where you go and live in your own imagination to escape the world and have validation from imaginary people. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, which is like a lite version of real OCD and being a real dick to the people you manage at work.

They're all manifestations of the same thing: invalidation. Chronic invalidation.

What's a personality disorder? It's when your ego gets so crushed by chronically being dismissed, ignored or dangerous to express that it gets seriously wounded. It's a frail thing that takes ANY threat to it seriously, and kicks in your fight or flight response. Your brain sees it as a real life-threatening thing and makes you explode or retreat with yourself to deal with it. Mama bear or scaredy cat, depending on your disposition and what has and hasn't worked in the past.

Go read up on the various personality disorders on your own. You'll find they all come from this one common root.

Do pardon my tone. I have a headache, and I hate repeating myself. Hence why I really need to put up a post about this. Seeing how common this thing that happened to me is on this subreddit is getting to me. I'm really starting to get pissed off with the world. That's the rage one of my PD's puts me in when I see the kinds of injustices I put up with growing up.

\---

(Rough sketch of my specific journey through this mess posted in the comments)

I've repeated this three times today. Many more times over the past few days. Someone posts about their problem - specific behaviors - and I ask if they were invalidated. Then I end up writing this out in one form or another. My PD doesn't like me having to repeat myself. Everyone needs to read this and understand it, if they answer "Yes" to being chronically invalidated.

Welcome to our sick society, people, where people intentionally victimize you when you're growing up, just so that they and every other user/abuser/toxic person can also use and abuse the victim.

Don't let them win. Don't give them what they want.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I have severe anxiety/gad and mdd. I have dealt with this for a solid 23 years now and have been on and off meds for just as long. I had a good year this past year where I felt great. Recently my anxiety has been at an all time high. I have been in fight or flight mode for the last month. I can’t take a satisfying deep breath, my chest hurts, my stomach hurts, I have headaches. I’m back on Zoloft and have been going through my “emergency” Ativan like candy, but feel like I’m just falling deeper and deeper. I need a good solid cry, but can’t. 

I need therapy but don’t currently have health insurance, but also can’t afford to pay out of pocket. 

I don’t know where to turn to for help. My pcp just makes me feel crazier than I am.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I’ll try to keep this short, but I think this is simple and important advice for anyone overwhelmed all the time. 
Basically the past 3 years have been the hardest, even with one of them spent living abroad in Australia, because my nervous system has been fucked after leaving a toxic relationship and moving back home with parents, killing myself working, then starting at a new job as an electrical apprentice and barely lasting 5 months. They said I wasn’t coach-able, my foreman was a POS with a short fuse, and basically my mental health and self confidence plummeted even further. I made the excuse that they fucked me over, which they did, but I fucked myself over by not being in the right state of mind to learn and absorb their teachings.
I kinda moved away from Canada to escape my problems but also to have fun and seek career opportunities. Even when in a new environment far away from home, I couldn’t shut my brain off and just be in the present moment most of the time. I just get nervous about fucking things up, because it was hardwired into my brain that I was a fuckup for not being able to have a good relationship or hold down the job that I wanted. It’s been like a dark cloud just following me around, and it affects my work, and my ability to make new connections. 

Anyway last night I was watching Limitless by Chris Hemsworth (absolutely amazing show) and in one of the episodes he’s learning to breathe properly to hunt and fish underwater, and as they were breathing on the tv, I followed along, and I felt so much lighter after. Today at work, I practiced that skill and it made me much more talkative, as well as calm under pressure. I can think so much more clearly, instead of rushing around and fucking things up, then being all nervous afterwards. 

Yeah so just breathe, and let your thoughts slow down so they don’t slow you down.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: This has been my main struggle right now. I know a lot of tips when it comes to self care and taking care of mental health but lately it's been seeming like nothing will work or get better. But the thing is I know I'm not giving it a good effort and enough time for things to improve. I've just finished college and moved back home which is soooo frustrating because while I care about my family, I valued the space and autonomy I had living away from home. My life was full, I had school, a job, I would go out and now my life feels dull and hopeless. Yes, I would have tough times in college (some of the hardest) but I bounced back.

Now, nothing is going my way. I have a part time job but my hours are being cut which cuts into my money and also has me at home a lot more which is frustrating (see above) and gives me a lot of time to focus on everything that is wrong. I'm unsure about my career even though a few weeks ago I got excited about a path. I find myself yearning for my old life that I had in college and now I feel so angry at everyone which makes me feel worse.

I'm trying to do the things : work out, journal, reading, affirmations, investing in myself, having a life outside of romance and being healthy in my dating life, reducing screen time, working on rumination, accepting things that I can't control and having faith that things will get better; I'm usually a painful optimist but now I've been feeling low for months and I don't know what to do. When the good habits don't "immediately" improve my life, I feel like giving up and fall back into negative thoughts and habits and I have a pity party and my emotions spiral out of control.

I wish I could just get away for a bit and reconnect with myself but that doesn't seem possible. Has anyone felt like this? How can I be patient with myself? How can I stick to the good even when it feels unlikely?

TLDR: Post-college life feels empty after losing independence and routine. Frustrated that healthy habits aren’t giving quick results. I want to know how to stay patient and consistent when life feels hopeless.

Edit: Took out some extra details.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Lately, I’ve been working on giving myself permission to set boundaries - without feeling like I have to justify them.

For years, my brain would tell me things like:

“You’re being selfish.”  
“They’ll be upset if you say no.”  
“You need a good reason to turn something down.”

But here’s what I’ve learned (thanks to a book called ***7 Lies Your Brain Tells You: And How to Outsmart Every One of Them***): those thoughts aren’t truths. They’re old mental scripts designed to keep me safe by keeping me agreeable.

Self-care isn’t just bubble baths and days off. Sometimes, it’s quietly saying:

“No, that doesn’t work for me.”  
… and leaving it at that.

You don’t need to write a defense essay for every choice you make.  
You don’t need permission to rest, protect your time, or prioritize your mental health.

If this is something you struggle with, maybe try this: next time you want to say no, do it simply - no overexplaining. See how freeing it feels.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Dear everyone, I saw a very popular discussion in selfcare recently on mental health apps, and I wanted to jump in and share some insight how to make sure the health apps you select are ***SAFE***.

I’ve worked with apps for the past decade. Mostly in areas that handle very sensitive data (mental health, healthcare, underage users, and finance).

The amount of shady practices I saw in the industry even 5 years ago is surreal, and I am really concerned about the rise of health and mental health app *coded by AI.* I wanted to share some (*hopefully helpful!)* guidance on what unsafe and safe health apps look like, and common practices that can expose your data.

I hope you find it helpful!

❌ **Not safe**

1. **Apps uncontrollably using third-party 'SDKs'.** 'SDKs' are tiny pieces of code from other companies in the app you download. Apps integrate them to do things like send push notifications, collect analytics, show ads or measure ads. These SDKs (read other companies) often collect data automatically (e.g. like which screens you visit) unless a developer disables it explicitly. Some don't even allow developers turn off auto-collection, which means your sensitive data (e.g. symptoms) may be sent elsewhere alongside your device ID, email, etc..
   1. **Recommendation:** Check the app’s Privacy Policy to see which SDKs are used and what data they collect. You also have the right to request this info from the developer.
2. **Apps with ads**. To show ads in the app, developers use third-party SDKs too, but it actually gets worse: other companies (advertisers) need to know who you are to show a “relevant” ad. For this, the app (publisher) must share your data with them.
   1. **Recommendation:** Avoid health-related apps that show ads altogether.
3. **Apps sending sensitive data off your device**. Data can be stored *ON YOUR DEVICE* or sent to *SERVERS*. Smaller developers, especially folks without experience handling sensitive data, often store it in ways that aren’t secure. For example, developers can see your entries with their own eyes *or* in the same database they have BOTH your personal info (e.g. email, name, and sensitive info (symptoms)). If there's a breach (e.g. Tea app), people outside will see it.
   1. **Recommendation**: If you can, choose apps that say they store sensitive data on your device (only you can see it), and not servers (others may see it). If data is stored on servers, the Privacy Policy should clearly explain the security measures, and ideally, the app should be security-certified.
4. **Apps with no data controls**. Apps collect *a lot* of data about you. A LOT. No, **A LOT**!!! But very few allow you to actually manage your data (e.g. delete it quickly).
   1. **Recommendation**: If you can, go for apps in which you can delete your data from the app's settings.
5. **“Built with AI in two weeks”**. This one’s self-explanatory :D
   1. **Recommendation**: Stick with apps that are regularly updated, clearly explain their data practices, and have detailed, non-templated Privacy Policies. Avoid any app that looks dodgy or vague about privacy.

✅ **Safest apps**

* Don’t use third-party SDKs, or if they have to, they give limited access to your data (you can see in their Privacy Policy)
* Have no ads *(cannot emphasise this one enough!)*
* Store sensitive data on your device
* Offer clear data controls in the settings
* Have a strong, detailed, and specific Privacy Policy

**Ideally:**

* Let you lock your account with Face ID / PIN / Touch ID *without* an upsell
* Transparent about their security practices and certifications

I hope it's valuable! Please stay safe and read Privacy Policies. ✌️

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I had a draining and frankly unpleasant interaction with a colleague that has left me feeling like a) I have no energy, b) I’m useless at my job and my life and c) I want to point out to them how miserable they are. It went something like this: 

1) I mentioned I’ll be working over Christmas, as I’m not particularly festive and I like the extra money. They said they “also despise Christmas - it’s for people who are dull and have no life. And I also hate people who go on holiday.” That’s … uh … almost everyone then? Travel and hiking are literally my salvation. I also don’t despise Christmas … more that it’s draining for me because of past trauma and I’d rather work. It’s fine if other people like it. 

2) They spewed hatred at cyclists, based on a tiny few interactions with a tiny few, probably bad-mannered, cyclists, in a capital city where there are plenty of bad-mannered road users of all descriptions.

3) They said they’d rather have a pint with a very right-wing, highly unpleasant politician in my country than listen to a couple of popular, overplayed songs on the radio. No, you wouldn’t. That is just ridiculous. I laughed and said “you’re joking” - they fixed me with one of those looks that said “I’m deadly serious and I’d thank you not to question me.”

4) They openly criticised someone’s work to me, without at first realising that it was my work. I asked them who wrote the offending item and they suddenly couldn’t find it to check. What a cop-out - we both knew it was my work, and if it was a problem then why not helpfully suggest corrections instead of bitching about it? 

5) They rolled their eyes and made disparaging comments when I spoke with a different colleague about our hobby of running, saying the only thing they’d ever run for was a bus. I said no, the only thing you’ve ever run is a bar tab. It wasn’t their conversation to hate on - and it was already fairly clear they hate hobbies and people with hobbies. 

6) To hear them speak, you’d think they are the only one who ever works to a decent standard. They criticised the work of other people (besides mine) all day, saying at one point: “How do these people get jobs?” Only when I suggested talking to a manager about the standard of work did they actually bother to talk to a manager about the standard of work. 

7) They disclosed that they were in an abusive relationship and have PTSD. That may be true - it’s not for me to judge, and I’m sorry if it is true. However, their constant need to complain about others and dominate every conversation makes me wonder if they are being honest. I was also in an abusive relationship years ago and it’s not the first thing I tell people. I don’t like the uneasy feeling of “I don’t quite believe this person.”

I went home feeling drained, bad at my job, and guilty for having hobbies that distract me from my own mental health issues. This person clearly has a lot going on too, but they project it onto others. I don’t know how to ignore them and take care of myself. I feel like I don’t deserve to take care of myself.

Original Idea: We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say "PM me anytime" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


"PM me anytime" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say "PM me" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.

Original Idea: Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the "role model" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the "depression" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- "I'm here to help" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The "giving help" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. "achievement" or "advice" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that "internet culture" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The "what is depression" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.

Original Idea: Hi everyone, 20 here. I still live with my parents sadly. It’s been around a month I decided to straight up avoid and short the interactions with them because I can’t stand it anymore. They know my mental state but still use the excuse of “just joking” and “we do it to motivate you” or “we’re just worried” to criticize me and my actions daily. For instance, I was just told by my mother that my room is shit and that I am obliged to clean it. I told her clearly, like every time, that this isn’t something someone like me wants to hear, and ofc she blamed it on me saying I’m too sensitive and take everything personally. This happens with everything to the point I just stopped talking with them. I’ve been in this state for two years now and communication doesn’t work, I tried it so much. They “joke” that I’m lazy, pressure me constantly that I need to do something, act offended if I tell them I don’t feel like doing what they want me to do or simply don’t wanna talk. I’m the one called evil if I want to just be alone.

I don’t even have the energy, how am I supposed to solve this or move out? I am scared and I feel alone. Of course I have a therapist already and she knows about it, but she hasn’t given me any real solutions and in a way I understand why. How can I think about leaving if I can’t even do the simplest of tasks most of the time? I’m always nervous around them, and just about being home. I wish I had a supportive family.

Original Idea: Nothing has ever really gone right for me, and if it's going right, i always and i mean **ALWAYS** fuck it up some how. I'm 30 yrs old with nothing to my name, no education, no job, no money, not a lot of friends, constantly betrayed by people i called my friends, constantly hating myself because im ugly and incredibly unattractive, I'm unable to do anything on my own without someone holding my hand due to how badly i've fucked my life up and that im too scared to do anything on my own to no risk fucking it up further. 

My life by all means is a joke and everyday i'm more convinced to wanna take my life because nothing is getting better and i'm not smart enough to make it better. I'm scared to take my life, but at the same time i rather be dead than continue to be a disappointment to everyone i care about(if i still even care about anyone)

Idk what to do anymore, and no one in my life is actually trying to help me. They give me temp solutions and refuse to actually listen and realize how bad of a position I'm in. My own father rather gamble away his money than help me and my mom can die any day now from the fent AND crack she fucking takes. 

I really need some convincing to go jump in front of a train or something since people rather push me to suicide than actually help me.

I was not crying. I was surprised. He was always abusing me, and I hated him very much. He did not treat me like my sister or brother. I was hated even though I was a calm and peaceful person. 

I wished I had died at that moment

## Mental Health
Original Idea: For the last 1-2 years I’ve let depression and anxiety completely control my life and enough is enough. Something I’ve noticed is that I tend to shut down and be quiet towards everything going on in my life instead of opening up to people. I know my parents would be a great support system but I’m terrified at the thought of even mentioning what I’m going through even on a baseline level. The same goes with professional help which I’ve had before but I found I tend to struggle truly opening up about what truly is going on.

I want to end all this stagnation and not improving myself but I don’t know how, has anyone been in this situation before?

Original Idea: I actually have no real reason to feel this way .My life is actually really good and I have people that care about me ,but ever since I was little I've wanted to kill myself and I can't pinpoint exactly why.The only reason why I haven't done it is because I wouldn't really have anything to write in my suicide note other than then the fact that I'm overwhelmed. 
I don't have a hunger for life ,I never have .After every minor inconvenience, I start thinking about killing myself and I get a little excited because being dead might finally mean taking a breather (ironic, I know)
The real reason I'm writing this is to see if anyone can justify the way I'm feeling

I’ve been on antidepressants I’ve been in therapy I’ve done things like eating healthy working out going on walks I’ve tried everything and I always end up feeling awful again, I even got kicked out of college . It’s physically painful it’s not the kind of depression where I just sit in my bed and deal with it. I’ll be walking around my room breaking down because of how much I don’t wanna be alive anymore. I wouldn’t do that to my close ones not that I feel like I have anyone there for me, but I know people would care if I went, so I wouldn’t do that to them I feel so guilty. I feel like a burden to everyone and I know there’s people out there suffering with life way worse than I do. I feel so guilty for feeling so depressed when I know I’m lucky, I have my trauma though. I know if I fight through that maybe one day I will start to feel better. But generally don’t think I can get through it. Doctors won’t listen to me practically begging people for help and it feels like no one cares. I just don’t wanna be alive anymore and it’s getting worse and worse to the point I can’t even get out of bed, I had permanent scars on my body, lost my appetite feeling physically unwell feels like I’m rotting away. I don’t know what to do

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I've (30m) been struggling with my ADHD and MDD for years, it's only recently that I've been medicated for it and have been able to make some progress and growth. It has affected my marriage and my ability to communicate clearly with my wife, as well as our banter and sex life. I get brain fog, I get distracted, I can't listen well, I can't focus, I can't comprehend, and according to her I cannot change. Which is true, despite my best efforts and despite the change I truly thought I saw in myself the past year, it doesn't matter.

She wants a divorce, and even though I have made true change to our issues after finally being able to overcome some of the hurdles of my ADHD and depression, it was too little too late. For her, it was what I should've done ages ago and it only took the threat of divorce a month ago for me to finally push myself to take more action and lead our family. Every other time we would talk about our issues, I would try to fix it for a few weeks, then get burnt out from the emotional and mental load of it all or she would reject my advances and I would let my rejection sensitivity slide me even deeper into depression. Every time I would push for couples therapy, she would push back and say we didn't need another person to help solve our issues. And instead of standing my ground, I took her at face value and let it be. I didn't have a spine.

I tried to make us work, I tried to overcome my disabilities, but I couldn't. And now my wife and son suffer for it. I lost myself trying to mold myself into the person she wanted me to be, which I know is unhealthy but I just wanted to be the ideal masculine guy she wanted to be with. In my entire life, I've never once been accepted for being who I am with the exception of my small group of friends. I thought for a long time that she did too, but she would later talk about how she looked down on me because of my hobbies and interests. I did everything to support her interests and her wants, but I tied my self worth to her and I'm only now learning how to recover from that.

I don't want to paint her in a negative light, she is incredibly loving and supportive and kind, but neither of us are perfect and we both have our own issues that we are seeking therapy for. I think I just pushed her to her limit because I couldn't figure my shit out and we couldn't find a common ground to feel fully vulnerable with each other.

Original Idea: Yep. 3+ fucking months. Anyone with a regular brain wouldn't understand. I'm so burnt out on life, I dreaded the long pauses between clicks on a shitty clothing store website, constant popups/ads to show me their AMAZING new deals, having to pull out my debit card and typing in the number, etc. It was easier to just wear pants with holes in them that would eventually get so bad, I could get arrested for indecent exposure. All that to avoid the hellish experience of “online shopping.” How I get through any other facet of my life is nothing short of a fucking miracle. A victory like this, is just another day for anybody else. Just have to wait for them to come in the mail and the cycle can begin anew. 🤠

Original Idea: 16 years of battling depression, just turned 31 last week. 

Over half my life destroyed by this.

I would have been better of serving a 16 years prison sentence for a white collar crime, if that time was spend non-depressed. 

Tried 3 different types of antidepressants already. No remarkable improvement, yet many negative side effects, and feeling completely 'medicated' by them....

Also went to 2 different psychologists, which were absolutely NOT helpfull. They didn't offer any therapy, only listened to my depressed stories. In retrospect I feel scammed by those 2. How can you improve when all your doing is whine and complain for an hour every week to 'an expert' that just nods and hums as feedback?

Original Idea: I have a friend who when I met was this energetic, laughing, independent person. We lost touch but have regrouped. However, she's different, and I don't know how to help anymore. Her dog recently died who was her world and I've been trying to be there as much as possible so she is not alone because she is afraid of being alone right now.

She also has an extremely toxic relationship with someone who cheats on her and is emotionally abusive but continues to go back to him even though she complains about him all the time. She has a back issue that makes it difficult for her to do normal tasks, she does PT for this. She won't go get a psychiatrist or new therapist. Her current doctor, who is not a psychiatrist, prescribes her 90 (xahnahx, spelled because I don't want this removed) a month, and she doesn't want to get a new doctor because she'll lose the prescription that is not helping her.

She struggles with eating and starves herself most days, you have to force her or remind her to eat. She is struggling now to function on her own. She is constantly upset. She breaks down to the point of screaming out of control. She stays in her house and seems to only be able to smoke weed all day. When I'm over she is always going down rabbit hole complaining about her lifestyle, her health, and her boyfriend.

Any advice I give her she doesn't take, in fact she usually does the opposite. When we hang out and I'm trying to get her outside, I can't get her dressed, I can't get her to eat, I can't get her out of her house. I have depression, so I can empathize. I am starting to feel helpless and I'm watching my friend fall apart. I'm getting frustrated and don't know what to do.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Creative writing vent (??) I wrote about my experiences with mental illness, depression, and living through the reality of it. It's a simple and corny metaphor, but one that helps me, and I hope helps others, too.

The sky is purple. It's as clear as day. I look up, and my cone cells see the horizon dominated by purples. I've seen it like this for months. It used to be blue like cotton candy and blueberries and baby boy clothes. The sun used to shine down and warm every atom of my face and down to my neck, letting out an involuntary smile from me. But now it's purple like the galaxy, purple like royalty. The clouds are grey and dark, and the sky's aura is one that hurts my soul. I know why it changed, and I know it's not normal. At least, not normal to me. I know it's not because the heat the blue sky gave warmed my soul like hot cocoa and joy, and these purple ones leave my heart frigid and sad, like a child without candy.

People tell me to shift my mindset, that if I exercise enough, blue will eventually return to my vision. If I fix my body enough, it'll be regulated again. I've had water. I've had exercise. I take walks. I do deep breaths. I do affirmations. I reach out to people. I do everything the pamphlets tell me, and all I get is an occasional blotch of blue, the faintest hints that eventually fade in like watercolor to the rest of the purples, covered up. But hey, time heals? Right? Just a few more days, a few more exercises?

The closest to blue I have is when I take medications. People tell me if I take enough of it, it'll mess up my body, my brain, my mind, my cone cells. My doctors tell me to ignore the fear-mongering, that it'll help the blue come to me, and if it doesn't or if it gets more purple, to call them. I take two of them, and one finally helps the sky be partially blue again. Pills with scary names and labels are the ones that help me see the skies people act like missionaries about to me. It's weird how some wellbeing practices that make no dent in helping me see blue make the sky completely bright blue for others, meanwhile the meds that make me slightly blue makes no impact on others.

Why is defeating my cone cells such a risky, unpredictable hassle?

I know that if medications and other exercises help me to see the sky is blue, that it's actually blue, that there's something up with me as opposed to others. I know that the sky is supposed to be blue, but I can't win against my brain, my vision. I know it's not supposed to be purple, because I do not think the strongest, much more anyone, could have survived in nature if everyone went through nights where the purple sunsets hurt like knives. There are too many people with blue skies for my purple to be normal. I know it's not normal, but so little helps me see otherwise. People tell me to get better, to fight, but get better from what? Is this a flu, a car accident, a sickness?

Is what is so obvious to me a sickness? How could so many tell me that my cone cells are valid for seeing purple skies, but also promote the blue skies so heavily over it. Is my vision not valid, not real? Is the sight of purple the presence of a sickness in my brain? Is that why I get recommended wellness advice, because purple is a symptom that I'm sick? Is that why I get told to love myself to treat the purple skies, because it'll alleviate my illness? Is that why medications help, because the chemicals help me see blue in the ways that "I reject purple. I see blue. I only want blue skies. I deserve blue skies." can't? Is my vision really that distorted? 

Are these purple skies that become oh so familar to me sickness that I can't control?

I try to tell myself that one day I will see blue. But how can I imagine warmth and baby blue during the nights when all I have is freezing cold and deep, rich purples? People want me to cling on and have hope during these moments, but 90% of them have never known what it's like to see rich darks surround the clouds in the sky instead of pastel lights. It's hard to truly empathize with those with purple when your skies have only ever been one color. It's impossible to let words have the same impact on my brain as the colors, controlled by hormones that my thoughts can't stop.

People leave when the skies are purple for too long. It leaves an impact on how I act. I wish I could act happy like one of the blues, but the truth is, I can't. I can't see their skies, so I can't act like them. They can't see my skies, so they can't empathize. They all tell me to get better, talk the talk, right before they leave. They get all positive when I don't even want to be here tomorrow to walk the walk. I cling onto what feels like a fantasy: the sky being blue. I barely have anything to make living to see blue worth it. I cling on what feels like incompatibility, trying to live in someone else's reality.

People also tell me that I can do this, I can control this, but I can't. I can tell myself the purple isn't real, but when I look up, I'll still see purple for most of my days and most of the day. I can't control it even when I try. Some people say it's a condition I can control, but I try so hard but most of it doesn't erase the purple. So maybe others are right. It is an illness and a sickness, even if it feels like home to me at this point. The purples are more there to me than the blues are. How can an illness feel so real? Maybe valid is just their way of saying "What you have is real, but not true." but appropriately. But how could my cone cells be wrong? Why would my brain work wrong, why would my brain hurt me? Isn't my brain supposed to help me?

So for now, I take the medications to treat the purple. I do the health and wellbeing exercises just to do them. I look straight up at purple skies and tell myself they're blue and I deserve to see blue. I want to try everything to see blue, even if this purple exists to corrode my soul and dissuade me. I try to believe that my perception is valid and my reality is wrong. And if nothing works, then at least I tried everything, right? I talk to friends who see blue and friends who see half purple half blue, who try to tell me it gets better. It helps a lot, to try to find warmth as much as possible under these cold skies.

To be honest, I like it better when people don't tell me to change my colors. They take me as I am. I know they want me to change my perception, but they know I'm too sick to. They know that it's unrealistic for me to see blue soon, even if they desperately want me to. I like it when they accept that tonight, it'll be purple, and it'll hurt. So I like it when they act as my blue. I like it when they keep me afloat in this stormy sea of hopelessness. They hug me, talk to me, and light me up. They treat me not like a purple, but as a blue, and gently divert my eyes from the sky and its pain. I deeply appreciate the way they so kindly treat me and don't alienate me because of my sickness, but instead show me what blue could look like and remind me why I fight. It makes me want to see blue again, and gives my soul the strength to go on to want to see that day when the whole horizon is warm with blues.

One day, I will see blues. Just not today. And that's okay, because I'm not letting the illness of purple skies win over me, even if it feels genuinely impossible today. And that's the best a purple can do ♡

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I’m 19 years old and graduated high school last year. I’ve had depression for about 5 years and have been hospitalized for wanting to die and anorexia for about 2 weeks 3 years ago. I’m always having bad thoughts about myself and suicidal thoughts about myself. I wanna die but also don’t wanna die. I’m probably too much of a coward to kill myself aways. I don’t know how but I somehow developed motion sickness and it’s just ruined my life more. I constantly feel nauseous, I don’t go out, don’t go to college, don’t have a job. I’m honestly a pathetic excuse for a 19 year old. I have no passion, ambitions, or motivation. I’m just existing. I have no hobbies either, I stay in bed 24/7 crying myself to sleep almost every night. All of my friends have jobs, college and are so smart, I’m so so proud of them. And then there’s me, useless, pathetic, dumb and betting my mom wish she stopped at 1 kid. I believe she’s growing tired of me even if she doesn’t show it. I’m just so tired of being like this that death feels like the only way to escape. I wrote a suicide note May 1st so I have that ready in case I actually go through with it. I believe that everyone will be happier if I was just gone. I haven’t been happy in years. I keep wishing that I could go back in time and do things differently but that’s not how things work. I keep trying to resist the urge to hurt myself. A couple of weeks ago, I had a breakdown down. My grandmother came upstairs because I had knocked a small table over in my room and found me just laying on the ground sobbing. My mother didn’t know until weeks later and classified it as a “tantrum” I didn’t argue with her about it because there’s no point. I’ve just been going through the motions, waking up, drinking to, eating noddles or whatever else is in the fridge, going back to my room sleep and repeat. My grandmother constantly makes little gabs at me. She once said “Why don’t you go outside and take pictures with your cousin” I’m ugly as fuck so I told her “I don’t do pictures” she proceeded to say “You don’t do much of anything”. It’s been constant little jabs like that that just hurt and don’t help at all, like I get it grandma, I’m a useless person. She favors my brother and all the men in the family anyways. I try not to let it get to me but it does. I don’t speak about my problems to anyone because I don’t want them to have to deal with my stupid shit. I’m just so tired and want it all to end, one way or another. I just don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t want to breakdown again just for it to be classified as a tantrum. I’m just so done with life but too scared to actually die, I don’t know what happens afterwards so that’s why I’m scared of it. Pathetic right? But I’m just a pathetic person. There’s a high chance no one will see this anyways.

Original Idea: I am having days like these when I just get very down whenever I think about my nonexistent personal life. I have 1 active friend online who keeps me company but this friend going away soon for an internship and won't have time much to keep me company and help. I am working on an online business. I have days when I just switch and am in my rational mind and work from day to night. But sometimes, on days like this, I just feel so behind in my personal life and alone. I feel frustrated with my personal and love life. I live in a small town, never been in a big city, did not have the opportunities to find quality people I can call friends. I had mostly surface level casual friends who I felt did not like me much and we did not have things in common. I moved to my parents city again, very uneventful, no people my age. I never had a lasting relationship, I tried dating, it never had any positive result. I been let down badly in few times I had interest in someone, and I been hurt. I am feeling upset at other friend who flirted with me online, never owned up, le dme on, after 2 years he says he wnats to replace me with some other girl he gonna meet locally. I feel frustrated and like my life never changes for better.

Original Idea: Tw: unaliveing mention 


I've seen quite a few unaliveing post as the comments are always saying alone the lines of "Don't do it" and "Keep trying" but why? Do those strangers care about these other strangers? How can you tell someone not to do something when you don't know or understand what's happening in their own life's?

I'm just genuinely curious what goes on in your brain when saying that to someone, and do you think it actually gets through?

Original Idea: I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at 12 years old. I fit the criteria, but I dont feel depressed. I dont think I am. I just worry that my diagnosis, even if its false, could ruin stuff in the future. SSRI's didnt help me, so I stopped taking them. 

I have felt depressed before, but not much. I feel kind of good, I think. When I read my old journals, sure, I seem pretty depressed. But I dont feel like that. I actually feel pretty great. I'm worried the doctors will try make me take them SSRI's again, because my family thinks I should. You wouldnt put a healthy person through chemotherapy, so why do they put me on antidepressants.  

I've been confused for a little while because I mostly feel good. I get sad sometimes, very very sad. Like, suicide risk type of sad. But its usually justified. Most people dont understand that. I felt sad for a little bit earlier today, but then I realized I actually feel  great. I've gotten a bit carried away. I am looking for advice, lol. Is there any way I can get MDD removed fron my medical record, or something?

My family is shit (basically abandoned me), boyfriends always used or assaulted me, i never have luck with fulfilling friendships. And meanwhile 24/7 the feelings of emptiness and dread. Also suffering through depression for more than 10 years now. And meanwhile...working, daily struggles, humans who love to abuse you. It literally sucks me dry. I only work, eat and sleep. In my free time i'm way too exhausted to do anything fun. I lost my passion and spirit. Basically living like a zombie.

I can't even remember the last i was genuinely happy?! If there would at least be one person i could trust. I hate living so much....you really don't know. Just wanted to rant...

Original Idea: My husband is 62 m and I’m a 49 w. He has cancer has to take medication forever that renders him impotent. It’s nearing 2.5 years of going through all his diagnoses and cancer treatments. We are both depressed and probably it affects his manhood a lot, so he’s retired now and being extra clingy. Last night he got upset that I wasn’t going to bed at the same time as him because I worked 11 hours and my back hurt (I had spine surgery in February) so I was unwinding. I asked him to please put away the leftovers. He just went upstairs to go to bed but came back out to say, also the  litter box needs to be changed, then he went to bed. He also was drinking so the extra controlling side came out. I silently limped around in pain and just cleaned up and finally went to bed with tears streaming down my face. 2.5 years of being treated badly going through my own stuff while taking care of him. Staying by his side in-spite of no affection or intimacy. People never understand how is for the spouse, everything is about the cancer survivor. People just hear the word cancer and forgive that person for anything without understanding nothing is a good excuse to treat people badly. Sick people don’t always treat others very well. He’s not sick but still, his cancer is being well managed. He’s still active and the cancer is remission and has been so since chemotherapy back since within the first 6 months of his diagnosis. He’s still active hasn’t had too many issues, actually he was still drinking through his chemotherapy. He was still working up until July now he’s retired. So now sometimes he smokes weed instead of drinking but still always something. Which I don’t care I just wish he’d treat me better. I had spine surgery in February but I went back to work in May because I was getting too depressed at home. There’s no affection or intimacy and I felt really trapped. He likes to keep me depressed because I think that’s how he thinks he keeps me.

Original Idea: Hi, I’ve been dealing with depression for a few months , diagnosed as major depressive disorder, single episode, situationally triggered. This past year has been full of traumatic events.

I’m no longer suicidal, but I feel emotionally numb, mostly anhedonic, and my anxiety is easily triggered. I’m against taking medication. I’m  functional, though lately I’ve been more fatigued.

My question is: Has anyone here gotten through something like this , without medication or CBT , just using self-help? Especially if you weren’t used to being depressed before.

You’re the only thing that will never truly leave me. You’re the only constant in my life. 

I have no one. I have nothing. I am alone. Lost. Sad. Broken. 

But I’ll always fucking have you around, like a the devil on my shoulder telling me I’ll never be enough. I’ll never be loved. I’ll never be happy.

Fuck you. 

I try. I really try. I thought I was getting better. I thought I was improving. I spent a couple months HAPPY. I thought it was finally fucking over. 

How stupid I was. 

How silly, to think that I mattered. To think people might care about me. To dare to have the thought that I might help somebody. Maybe somebody could benefit from me. Maybe I can make people happy. 

It’s worse to have experienced a moment of bliss that I’ll never have again. I wish I never got to experience the happiness. 

You win again, depression. You always win. 

Fuck you.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Hello all - thought I'd come here to dump my sad story. This is pretty extreme so I'd expect some skepticism. Anyways here it goes. 

Some number of years ago, while an undergrad student living with my parents, I experienced a sudden and profound dissociative fugue. When I eventually recovered and regained my wits, I became suspicious of the people I was living with and after some argumentation agreed to go to the hospital. There I was quickly certified by a psychiatrist and diagnosed with Psychosis NOS. I remained on a psych ward for several weeks before being discharged on extended leave (that is, as an involuntary patient not explicitly confined to a hospital). For several more years I remained in the mental health system, all while continuing to function as an adult (studying and working). Eventually I was discharged completely, however more recently it has come to my attention that footage containing myself featuring extreme abuse has been circulating, likely disseminated for monetary gain. A number of other people (co-workers, acquaintances) who have gained some knowledge of my situation have made more or less subtle comments concerning military torture techniques, such as might be used to break a person's will and compel them to commit degrading acts. Others have expressed shock or various other reactions upon (I am assuming) seeing the footage or becoming aware of its existence, however I have not engaged with them regarding this topic. Several have even specifically referenced Kafkaesque situations involving maddeningly complex bureaucratic corruption and the dystopian film *Brazil* (where the protagonist is eventually tortured to insanity). 

In short, I was likely drugged, forced to undergo some form of psychological torture, and then filmed while being abused in a state of enhanced suggestibility or weakened resistance. My initial interaction with *some* of the nurses and doctors in the mental health system leads me to believe that they deliberately misdiagnosed me as an attempt to gaslight and formally discredit me. To top it off, this abuse was perpetrated by my own parents (I am their only child) who managed to dupe most of my other lifetime friends and associates into believing that this was somehow justified as a punitive measure for my bad behavior (which didn't actually exist); the core motivation being monetization of the footage. 

An even more horrific second point: I have also noticed that some of my social media feeds seems to be artificially saturated with disturbing content. I am aware that such feeds will naturally mold themselves around one's digital footprint, however the degree of saturation does not seem commensurate with the degree to which I have searched the relevant themes or topics, these being: powerlessness, torture, abuse, humiliation, corrupt authority figures abusing their power, and some even more specific, such as entrapped/powerless victims attempting to make covert appeals to strangers for aid. I have documented some of these if you would like to see for yourself - as a rough estimate, I'd say that %60-%70 of the content of the relevant feeds have been affected in this manner for the past 8-12 months since it's caught my attention. This could just be coincidental though.

So needless to say I'm pretty bummed out about this. I realize this might sound like an actual schizophrenic delusion to most people, and if anyone wants to question me a bit further I could probably convince you I'm not insane. That being said, the main point of posting this here is to solicit support for the psychological aftermath, so if you want to just take my story for granted and help with that that'd be fine too.

I started to think about how I don't feel that I desire eternal life because im scared of living forever. I then thought that I felt distrusting of god for this. This caused me to spiral and have intrusive thoughts about killing myself. Now its all i can think of and I go back to school in 2 weeks. I have also has issues with dissocating and feeling detatched from myself. I don't know what to do about this spiral because i feel like im in physical pain and my death is in front of me.

Original Idea: I'm 28. I've been anxious and depressed since I can remember and I've gone through multiple therapists and treatments to help me manage this. I'm getting increasingly anxious that I am going to look back on my life and not remember anything because I cannot connect to people, or a purpose on earth. I'm the classic case. Lovely husband, friends, job, house... but I can't seem to settle into it. When I speak to friends, I feel like no one is really hearing what I'm saying. If I have something good happen to me (wedding, getting a dog, finishing graduate school) I'm never \*in my core\* happy about it. I feel like there's always something off. 

I've always felt like an alien, like my life isn't mine and I'm not in control of my destiny. I have phases of feeling better, but then everything will come crashing down again. I feel no excitement towards the future, only stress and anxiety of the agony I'll face. 

I truly want to feel better. I want to feel like I'm actually here. Does anyone have advice on how to fucking chill out and stop ruining my own life?

I mean honestly why the fuck am I alive if I can’t experience good things. What am I even doing anymore days go by then weeks then months then years and instead of getting better it’s like the longer I live the lower the hole I’m in goes. and every time I’m at the bottom and think it can’t get any worse it always manages to surprise me. You wouldn’t want an injured or sick animal to suffer so you put it out of its misery. So why the fuck can’t someone do the same to me

## Mental Health
Original Idea: It really truly is mentally exhausting dealing with people, trying to interact with them, it’s like living in a separate world people just genuinely don’t understand the situation I go through, how much i genuinely hate waking up in the morning, getting dressed, commute to work, battle my own thoughts about me not wanting to be anywhere but either in a bed or grave all day, that I’m not good enough for anyone or anything. That dreams are meant to be broken and that nightmares come true, I clock out then mope around all day just to do it all over. I genuinely hate that people are happy and I’m not, I’m not the type of person that would destroy someone’s happiness for my own gain but those seem to be the type of people that I mess with online or not, it’s the type of people that’ll poke a beehive with a stick and then act offended when they get stung, and as a result the beehive gets torn down.
I’m tired of living, I hate all life and I don’t feel like doing anything anymore

## Mental Health
Original Idea: My boyfriend and I have been together for three years. Throughout our relationship, he’s ended things with me multiple times, only to beg me to come back. Every time, because I truly love him and can’t seem to let go, I take him back.

He says hurtful things like “know your place” every time I argue back with him and that I should feel lucky to have him. He tells me that “anyone would kill to be me” because I have him every single time I raise an issue with him he calls me ungrateful because he pays a bit more than half of the bill (he agreed to do this because he’s on double my wage and chose the house) and without him I’d have nowhere to live 

In the past two weeks, he’s kicked me out of the flat three times (the tenancy is in his name), leaving me to sleep on the floor at a friend’s place.

This treatment is wearing me down. I feel worthless ; like a piece of shit that can be thrown away whenever he’s done with me. It’s crushing to know that even the person who’s supposed to love me can treat me this way.

I have been bullied all my life school parents partners and I’m starting to think that I actually am what he says I am because how does all this happen to one person without there being a reason

I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die either. I just wish I could disappear. I hate myself I have so much work to do and I vent even being myself to do it because I simply do not care

Original Idea: So I've (34m) been dealing with severe depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I remember being able to recall things rather quickly and being able to do things such as build decks for Magic, Yugioh, etc. Now, it just seems like my brain struggles hard with remembering things from my past and activities like deck building or even playing the card games just feel too complicated for my brain to handle. It has me worried and wondering if my brains just screwed for the rest of my life

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I'm 18. There seems to be so much death and suffering around me and I don't know how to cope with it other than this. I can't tell anyone else, they're having a hard enough time as it is.

My granddad on my mums died at the start of the year. His health had been in decline for a year or 2. Some form of rare aggressive cancer in the end. He was old for the country in which he was born and lived, lived through some quite horrible times. He wasn't that old compared to standards in this country. I went to see him with my mum in December (abroad, so that complicates things) - I sort of wish I hadn't. His brain was fine, he was still fighting, but his body was clearly not in any good way. Because of cultural reasons and his wishes, he was being cared for at home by his daughter (my mum's sister). He was bloated, constant hiccups and other sounds that I don't know how to describe other than if I heard them from a person, I would assume death was soon. When he died, my mum was there, and the rest of my family and I went for the funeral. Buried in a place with a great view of a ridge line of a mountain range that I'm well familiar with.

My mum suffered two miscarriages many many years ago. First she had my brother (now 25), then two miscarriages, then me. They both had to die for me to exist. How the hell am I supposed to deal with that. My dad decided that their shared gravestone would have the top cut with that same ridge line, now visible from my granddad's grave (of course, thats coincidence). So now I look out from my granddad's view onto this ridge, and cannot help but associate it with "I wouldn't exist if they hadn't died". Yet I feel absolutely no attachment or wonder about these siblings. I used to join my mum when she went to the cemetery but I haven't been in a while. She usually cried but I don't know if the pain is fading yet. All I did while she was crying was try to comfort her and wonder why I felt no attachment and was visiting 2 peoples graves who I'd never known.

My grandmother on my mums side is currently in the process of dying. She wasn't handling the slow death of her husband (of like a huge number of years) well. I don't know what she's got, but her memory is gone - she doesn't really know who my mum is, or who I am, but she seems to remember that we were once at least important to her. She was being cared for at home (abroad, again by her daughter, my mum's sister) in her deteriorating state. Again, on my granddad's wishes, she was not to be put in a home. I don't know why my mum and her sister decided to respect that after he died. My grandmother took a knife that she had hidden somewhere after the rest of the knives were removed (supposedly) and cut up some furniture, apparently attempting to protect my mum's sister's daughter's daughter (age something like 5) who lives in the same house. My mum's sister had to call the police because what else do you do in that case. So she was removed to a mental hospital, then has recently been released to some old peoples care home, which, if you're thinking like one in the UK or somewhere, is not. There's 3 elderly people all in one not great room, minimal carers. But whatever, it's what's expected in that country. She's lost her mind and she's basically now just skin draped over some bones. My mum's sister visits her everyday, as does my mum when she's there.

My mum has suffered though this of course. But because they're abroad, there's of course the consideration that whenever she sees them might be the last. So she's constantly travelling back and forth. When she's here, she has at least two (loud video) calls a day, usually 45 mins long each, with her sister, plus maybe one every few days with her sister's daughter. The phone calls usually are her sister reporting my grandmothers condition and deterioration. Of course they are usually emotional. Often this interrupts whatever little family time we're having, often meals. She never asks before but sometimes apologisies after, and I never say anything. It's not ok.  This makes it feel like whenever she's here, she's not really. I tried to tell her this isnt good for her mental health, but of course, its more nuanced than that and that means we have fallen out over this. But it means she's bringing all the death and suffering into this house, or leaving to be abroad, meaning no stability. It's also ruined one holiday: we had planned to take some time out in the same country abroad, just the 4 of us to escape - my mum didn't go because my granddad supposedly wouldn't make it a week and she wanted to be there for him. It took another 7 months for him to die. I know that things like that can't be estimated, and I don't blame her for wanting to be near her dad. But we had gone through years of ups and downs at this point, at least 2 death scares a year. And still my mum rides the ups and downs and reacts impulsively. But I don't blame her. A recent holiday (a rare one not to the same country abroad) was in jeopardy because my grandmother might not have survived the week. Again, she did. But I don't know what I would do if I was in my mum's position.

My grandmother on my dad's side died a few years back. I don't really remember her in any good condition. Diabetes and brain troubles towards the end. Took her about 8 years or so to die. Spent a large number in multiple care homes, and more being cared for at home by my grandad on my dad's side.

My other grandad has just been diagnosed with something weak heart. Which is normal for aging. But he's doing alright so far at least, although his sight and hearing is declining. 

Someone else in my family on my dad's side that I had never met died the other day. In hospital. Don't know the full story, but he had been alone and refused pretty much any social interaction for many years. So died with no close relatives, no comfort. Already my parents are talking about some kind of problems with his will.

I work at a fast food place. There was a guy there in kitchen that I never really talked to much (language barrier), but we always said hello to each other whenever we saw each other. Nice guy. I came in one evening not long ago for work. He had died unexpectedly the previous evening (I think at home, maybe in his sleep). Not nice, but it happens. Had an assembly at my school a few days later where they give out awards to people. Called a name out for a girl who was in year 10. Didn't show up. Saw her name on the screen. Same surname. Very unique surname as well. Her dad died while working 6 years in a boring meaningless job just to try and support her and maybe trying to save for some time in the future with her. Never got it. I mean you hear all the time that you should enjoy life and not take it for granted. But in reality everybody does take it for granted - we have to work. Some people have to work more than others and get nothing from life in return. Yet I'm still working there, not often socialising because I struggle in those situations. 

On holiday a couple years ago to see the family abroad for one week. Left our cat with my brother at our house (he hadn't moved out by that point), because he didn't come. He died the morning on the day we got back, just before we got back. Not sure what happened, maybe clipped by car, maybe a heart attack, but he was not injured. Found by a neighbour who initially tried to take him to our house, but my brother didn't hear the door, so he took him to the vet. My mum got that phone call while we were travelling back. 

And now my mum's talking about moving back abroad when she gets a bit older. And I'll be having to make these same decisions to stay or go when she inevitably gets ill (assuming she doesn't die soon). 

My grandad died of a cancer that might be genetically passed down to my mum, me and my brother. Who knows what that'll come to, but that's not nice to find out - and im not sure my parents are aware that im aware. I think they told my brother but didn't realise I could hear.

At the same time, I'm struggling to have any self esteem to socialise. I guess that this and due to other circumstances. When it comes up in conversation rarely with my mum, and things being implied so it's a bit difficult to reproduce any conversation here. But basically, I talk about a girlfriend, which I dont have. Yet repeatedly my mum always responds with "... or a guy, I don't mind". I'm straight. I don't know why she feels the need to say its ok if I'm gay. I've said I'm straight, I have always been straight. I assumed it was just my mum trying to be weirdly accommodating. But then I was at another family gathering on my dad's side, which I tried to avoid but was forced to attend. I don't remember how it came up, but it was going down a similar path, and my dad's brother's daughter said "... or guy". Do I come off as gay? Is it because I don't have a girlfriend yet? Why are people being overly accommodating when I'm never mentioning being gay?

I don't know how to handle this. When I was visiting my mum's mum in the care home, another of my mum's sister's daughter's asked me if I had seen was scary. I said it wasn't. It wasn't. I have been exposed to this too much now that suffering before death seems normal and learning someone has died is relieving. Or makes me question why we accept living in this way. Yet we'll all still accept it. Is it normal to exposed to this at age like 13?

If anyone from my family finds this, if anyone then my brother (who's avoided the worst of it by moving out and having a girlfriend and full time job), then I guess it's all out. But I don't know if that would make things easier or not?

Original Idea: I’m a 21 M that feels like I’ve completely lost my identity after years of trying to mask my pain. The thoughts of suicide and self harm have reappeared within the last month after they took some time off. Trying to tell myself it will get better but idk how much longer I can take the pain of life. Hope y’all don’t feel the same.

Original Idea: Preface: I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit to post this in. Feel free to take it down if it is not.

I've got a good education, finished a bachelor in CS and pursuing a master's now. I managed to hold down a good job for a while, but ended up quitting to focus on my studies. I've got a supportive mom who helps me stay afloat.

And yet I just can't bring myself to function like a normal human being. I don't know how so many people go about their lives, ticking like clockwork. They dutifully go through the motions every day, they have a set time to prepare food, a set time to mow the lawn, a set time to clean their house, etc., and every single week they go through with everything.

I almost can't bring myself to do anything on a schedule. I can only really function doing things on a here-and-now basis. If the apartment is unclean, then maybe the 10th time I feel guilty about it, I'll finally get around to actually cleaning the place. If I'm dangerously close to running out of clean underwear, I'll wait until almost the last possible moment to actually wash the stuff and avert catastrophe.

Whenever I get into a proper routine, it almost always ends up crashing into a wall of "what's the point". Why spend so much of your precious limited time on this earth cleaning this stupid thing, when you could be doing something else.

The rest of my time, I just try to escape. When I was a kid, there wasn't really much of anything for me to do at home; my parents are divorced, and my single mom had to work her ass off to support us. So once I was done with the schoolday and homework, I would just disappear from this world. I would watch YouTube or cartoons all day, just to forget that I existed.

I think that was partially what got me into CS, because while programming you can just lose yourself in the task at hand, and forget about everything around you.

Eventually I decided that I didn't want to run anymore, and I wanted to build a life that I actually want to live for myself. And no sooner had I come dangerously close to being actually happy, than covid hit, and the lockdowns and online schooling were like a wave that obliterated the sandcastle that I had built for myself.

Now I feel like I will never be happy, like there is no happiness for me to be found in this world, like I was not meant for it. I keep making attempts at it, but it's mostly a swing and a miss. I just seemingly can't find a place where I'll fit, where I'll feel like the puzzle piece that completes the whole. I feel unnecessary to most places, and unnecessary to the world. I don't know why, I just don't feel at home.

Talking with people helps sometimes, and sometimes maybe not. My mom has done more than anyone else for me in this world, and yet sometimes when I ask for advice or am vulnerable with her, the response I get feels as if someone has just poured a bucket of ice cubes into your bath. So cold and matter-of-fact, that you lose your entire breath and shrivel up.

Yet other people somehow seem to get on with life. And I don't really know how.

I don't really have any goal in mind with this post. It's just a scream into the void.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: 31F here. I've had depression on and off since I was a teen but this year has been the worst. I think I expected my 30s to be better than my 20s, but I've never felt more stuck than I do now.

I am a freelance musician and have dedicated almost my whole life to being a violinist. When I graduated school, COVID-19 hit and I lost all my contracts. I decided to pivot and spent a few summers trying to get pre-requisites for medical school and volunteer experience. When the gigs started coming back (I mostly sub for orchestras) then I sort of put medical school on hold and started freelancing again. I really regret this decision.

Due to the upcoming recession, a lot of orchestras are tightening budgets. I had a good few years, but now I've found myself being left out of work that I had gotten in the past. It feels personal, like I have done something wrong and that's why they don't want me. I have barely anything scheduled for the fall, when last year I was really busy. I have also just been left out of a few gigs that I used to be hired for because someone better came along. It's a tough reality to cope with in this industry. My self worth hinges on the work that I get, and I know it's not healthy. I regret not picking a different area to study. Being a musician means that I work really hard for almost no money and none of it ends up mattering anyway because there's always someone that they decide they want instead. There is no loyalty. No matter how hard I work, it's never enough.

If I leave the industry, I'll feel like a quitter. But I can't imagine doing this for the rest of my life either. I guess it feels even worse now because I'm starting to get to the age where all my friends are getting married and having kids so they don't talk to me anymore. I have a bad relationship with my family and my relationship with my partner is a bit rocky right now. I feel like things should be better because I worked so hard, and they aren't. When I wake up I get hit with a sense of dread, like how can I keep living with this despair day after day. The only thing that's stopping me is that my roommate committed suicide when I was in university and I remember the absolute chaos and sadness it caused for everyone around her, and that I'm scared of it hurting. I haven't decided yet which method to use because they all seem painful and not 100% foolproof.

  
Thank you for listening to my inner thoughts. I know my situation probably isn't that bad but I am feeling worthless and alone. I just hope this feeling passes before I end things but I know it probably wont.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I have in the past spiralled but for the most part I'm high-functioning. I wash myself if I need to be somewhere, brush my teeth every day, try my best to eat and socialise, show up to work, etc. Yet, my room is a total mess and I feel absolutely no joy or hope in my life. I have constant dread, anxiety, and this heaviness in my soul. When I get home I pretty much just wait for the day to end. 

I feel as though because I'm functional I've been overlooked by a lot of psychiatrists and doctors. I was told that I'm doing well because I'm doing the bare minimum. When I point out to them that I feel like a walking husk, aimlessly stumbling through the world, I am reminded that at least I'm still taking care of myself. I was even once told by a former therapist that adult life isn't what kids think it is, and it's full of mundanity and disappointment. The only mental health professional that hears me is my current therapist. 

I also feel that my feelings are overlooked sometimes because I don't come into the doctor's/psychiatrist's office sobbing or shaking. I'm pretty dissociated from my feelings and, while I can explain them, for the most part they don't show in my body. Maybe because I'm so matter-of-fact about my feelings it's assumed that I'm faking it. 

Honestly, it's so frustrating and exhausting. Why is the marker for good mental health productivity? Why isn't my happiness important? I'm not asking to be euphoric all the time, just to feel okay. 

I know there's hope and that's why I'm still here. It just sucks feeling like not many people understand.

Original Idea: There definitely more people that have it worse than me and are struggling more than me. The problem is, I'm a weak person, I'm tired of living on with constant financial instability. Constantly worrying if I can afford next month or the month after that. Constantly worrying if I actually have a future ahead if me or I might just end myself.

What's the point of all of this? I'm struggling, I'm tired and I just want to end myself. It's like forcing someone to continue playing a game they don't enjoy. Why do I keep living? I feel like I've already taken the wrong turn in life and I can't get out. I made my choice and I'm stuck with that choice. I'm in too deep and I'm tired of taking a different turn. What if that choice is pointless too? What if I'm just slowly sinking and spiriling down until eventually I couldn't take it anymore? 

I'm tired. I'm not looking for advice, I just want to vent

Original Idea: TW: Self harm, if that wasn't already clear

I've already done it once in 2022, but my scars are so thin and light that even I can barely make them out from my skin. I don't want that, I want more. I've had the idea of doing it again floating about in my mind every moment since then, but as of the last maybe year and a half, it's become more of a craving rather than just something I'd like to do. I can't imagine my body not being covered in scars, from the chest, to the thighs, to the arms and sometimes even the face. I don't realize these fantasies because I hate to see my parents crying or asking if they can do anything to help. I'm not even meaning this as a means to get help, let alone to kill myself, it's just my body and I want it to look like that, same way you can cut your hair, get plastic surgery or go to the gym. I've recently come to realize that even I find them attractive even in other people. Someone with these marks, they've struggled as I do, maybe even more, and that's hot. They're real. I want to be real too. I want people to see me, and to not just think I'm a coward who can't handle feelings when "Everyone feels that way". I want people to be able to clearly see this, so that people who are down can find me like a light amidst a thick veil of mist and know I won't judge or hurt them like everyone else seems hell-bent in doing. Call it what you will, but I see these scars as reassuring, they tell the tale of despair that so many wouldn't notice otherwise, and tell me that you're approachable, because you, at the very least, have seen the world through the same lens I do. The only time I've felt comfortable in so long was amidst people who were down in the gutter, and I want those people to find me again, regardless of what everyone else might think of me.

Original Idea: Since I was 15 I have always felt alone (M26 now), even though I have friends. It really hurts me to wake up in the morning and not see any messages, or even at the end of the day to see that no one has sent me at least a "hello." I'm dating someone but she doesn't want to be my girlfriend (yet, she doesn't feel ready) and I feel unloved. I haven't spoken to her in two days and she hasn't asked me anything. I see my friends married, with children, and happy even though life hits them hard. She'll probably break up with me or I'll break up with her, I don't think it will last more than a month.

I consider myself a normal person, I always make my friends and those around me laugh, I like to make others happy. But nobody wants to make me happy. I really have very low standards for dating or making friends. I get attached easily to anyone who shows me some affection and even then I can't get someone. If I were someone physically ugly I could understand it, but that's not the case.

I live with my parents and don't have a job. My mother emotionally abuses me, calling me useless, lazy, and worthless. When in reality, I love working and feeling useful. In my previous job they even nicknamed me "Saint Gaetano" (He is the saint of work). Only now I'm depressed and I have a hard time working and doing activities.

Original Idea: (didn’t know a sub to post this is but alr) but gosh I am so close to hating my sister my parents wanted me to stay with her for a WHOLE ASS YEAR so they can move then when I am finally able to move my dream is ruined by her going with me… like bitch why are you here I’m the only one who’s meant to be here but some of you might be asking “what did she do?” To sum it up basically what she did is lock me in a room for 13 hours if not more in a day, only Feeds me once a day, bloody pads everywhere and sometimes shit in the toilet (not outside Atleast) but she also keeps blaming me for shit I didn’t even do and all she does is yell at me. Also we had 5 whole days to pack our stuff and when the day finally comes she’s straight up pissed yelling at my brother and I because “WERE GONNA BE LATE” and after I had to be awake for 2 days (same with my brother) she then calls my stuff “junk“ WHEN ALL I HAD WAS CLOTHES,1 SET OF LEGOS AND BOOKS,…… while she had 4 suitcases worth of stuff and I had a tiny backpack that I couldn’t even put my clothes i Had for years inside my backpack. Time skip when To when we finally get there I asked her “ why are you even here if all you do is complain about being here when you’ve been here a dozen times in your 22 years of living?“ then she has the audacity to say “ so I can help you “ WITH WHAT EXACTLY. And btw she always compares me to some random kids at my old school I haven’t been for a year that I don’t give any shits about and she expects me to have a 3.8 gpa when I grow up. at this point she should go back to fucking Maryland or wherever she wants to go so do y’all have any advice to confront her or talk about her with my parents (horrible grammar by the way

Original Idea: This is just a vent into the void.
Im in my mid 30s and been depressed since im 11 or 12 years old.
I think i got destroyed twice in life and never really recovered.
No matter where i am i feel out of place and think everyone else would have a better time without me.
I never went to any partys or occasions, never had a relationship and never got intimate with someone.

One of the main reasons why im still here said that if the life has no joy maybe it should end.
And i cant find any reason anymore not to just leave.

I just wanted to type it out to someone since there is nobody i can talk to.

Sorry for my english it is not my first language

Original Idea: i have no where to share this and maybe no one will ever read this but i want to let it out. 

i was having a mental breakdown today and sobbing in a dark alley leading to a main road where no one would see me (at least i thought). i had a sudden intrusive thought to end it all by running onto incoming traffic and right at that moment, a kid from the house above suddenly yelled from the window asking “who are you? who is this person running?”

i immediately turned back and started sobbing even harder. i wasn’t going to act on the thought, but that innocent kid unknowingly saved me in that moment.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: i have been living with depression for over 8 years now. it started when i was 11 with a sudden death of my beloved cat, who was the only creature i felt safe with. living in a constant loneliness and silence this cat was the only thing that gave a sense of joy, love and company. he was like a child to me, the younger brother who i wanted to protect from everything no matter what. but he died of cancer and with him died my ability to hope for the better, to develop a loving and happy relationship. the second thing that fell down on me was the realization of my homosexuality that lead me to abandon myself and create a new personality in a fear of my true self's disclosure. after these two accidents i was never the same and still trying to deal with these traumas today. all these years before 2022 i had been living in isolation and battling asthenia that fell upon me after the first depressive episode at 11. i couldn't think, i couldn't read and couldn't concentrate on anything but what a failure a became and the dissociation from my body that made me a husk of a person i once was.,

 i'm ukrainian, so i left the country after the war broke out and a month before the war my mental state had begun to worthen. first panick attacks and the constant feeling that i was going to die shortly. this state really bloomed when i became a refugee in europe where my second depressive episode truly began. every day, every minute i had the thoughts that i needed to die because i regarded my self as misery of my family and a worthless creature that didn't deserve a life. at this time i started going to therapy and got diagnosed with depressive personality disorder. i started taking sertralin and this a year went by. then i found a different psychiatrist and with her help i sarted a new course of quetiapin and carbomazepin, because i had seizures and hallucinations quite often, now living in germany as a refugee. still very isolated with my family who abused me and blamed me for their problems. around this time i started to drink alcohol, while being on a high amount of pills and got addicted to alcohol to drink away the loneliness and abuse inflicted on me. a had a suicide attempt around that time. a year ago i went to czech republic to study english philology at the uni. this education and time spent studying for this were one of the britest moments in my life but unfortunately there is a chance of me being deported because of me assisting the money laundering. see, i have become a victim of a scammer on the internet who used my bank account to launder crypto money. he stole around 5k euros and when i went to the police they started to suspect me of assistance. while the prosecution is going on, i'm ok but if they accuse me, i have a chance of going to prison up to one year and deportation. the most heavy thing for me is that this whole sutation could influence my studying, the thing for what i worked so hard is about to be taken from me and it's very hard for me to comprehend the shit i have got into. this whole situation felt like anouther dream i had at night where som eof my relatives died or i've been exposed or laughed at. but it was real. 

i wish i was dead right now but i have the mother who would probably end her life too if i ended mine. i don't know why i wrote this whole thing down, i'm sorry for your time

Original Idea: I’m 27, (f), I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer this year, as well as degenerative disc disease. I was born with muscular dystrophy and a congenital heart disease. My heart has gotten significantly worse due to the disease and stress. I want to give up. I don’t give up on anything, I keep trying until I get it right. But man, I’ve been trying for 27 years, I simply don’t want to anymore. I’m exhausted, I’m in pain (emotionally and physically). I need a miracle. I feel alone. I’m afraid to talk about how I truly feel. I say truly because I do talk about how I feel, to an extent. But nobody knows my true and raw feelings/thoughts. It never ends well whenever I do finally get everything off my chest. No matter who I talk to, it never ends well for me. Even if I’ve spent all day prepping myself on how to display my emotions, and how to communicate properly, it just goes south. I’m dying and I don’t want to spend however long I have left on this earth feeling hopeless and worthless. I’m tired of being anxious, I’m tired of being overworked and overwhelmed. I don’t want to do this anymore.

And as for talking to friends, I dont really talk to them cause I dont want to and also because I don't really get time to because I study  
I want to top my class but for some reason my performance just isnt here and I feel completely dead inside  
No excitement, fear or anything, just like watching the world through a window

Original Idea: My boyfriend and I are both 16 and have been together for over a year and were friends before that, he has been depressed since about january of this year and has asked his parents for therapy or to try and get meds but they don't know the severity of the situation and haven't been acting as fast as one would hope (not saying they're bad parents- it's just hard to tell the people caring for you how unhappy you really are, ya know? They only know a part of what he's going through). This morning he told me that he's not sure if he feels love for me anymore because of his depression, and also that he had a dream where he told me things he "doesn't really like (about me)" but won't tell me what they are because he doesn't want me to have to change.. but that's side tracking a bit. I told him I would be there to support him no matter what and that we could take a break or do whatever he needs right now with our relationship (to which he just said act how we normally do), I have sent him "self esteem journals" and therapy type worksheets but I'm not sure how often he really does them.. I've even gone as far as to introduce more niche types of therapy like age regression but that took too much effort for him to get into despite it seeming to help once or twice. How else can I help him? Will his love ever come back or should I accept it and just support him as a friend? I'm willing to do anything for him.. despite the dwindling goodnight messages and petnames that are dropping like flies, I have never stopped showing my love but I just feel so stuck and scared for both him and us. Is there anything I can do or people who have been through similar situations with their partner?

I’m mostly sharing because I feel stuck and could use support or encouragement from people who understand what it’s like to cope with ongoing depression. Any experiences, thoughts, or words of empathy would really help.

Original Idea: Hi everyone. 

I am new here. 43f struggling with depression.

I am basically my mother's caretaker. She's been ill, and I take her to all of her medical appointments, help her with her daily tasks, make sure she eats, etc etc. I love my mom and want her well, so I do this, but it hasn't been easy. I have struggled with my mental health most of my life, and I feel like her health issues and my constant worry is making me so much worse. I have always been depressed, but never like this. I truly feel hopeless, like things will never be good. I am off in the summer, but most of it has been spent taking care of her and worrying about her constantly. I feel trapped and don't see a way out. 

Not only am I depressed, I am angry. I have two sisters and they don't help much. I feel like it's all on me. My mental health is declining day by day. I even snap at my mother a lot because I cannot deal...and then I feel guilty. And then I snap again. A vicious cycle.

I know I need help, but I don't know where to start. It's been so bad that I just wanted to go to the hospital but what will she do if I am not here?

Sorry this post is all over the place. I am just venting.

Thanks for reading.

I despise my appearance, and I honestly don't know what to do about it. I have an ugly face, terrible hair, small penis, weird head shape. I really hate how I look, and honestly it has been driving me insane. I know I need to learn how to love myself, but I don't think I'll ever be able to do so without being able to look good. It's driving me crazy, and it's making me become a worse person. The little personality I had is being drained by my hatred towards my own body. I'm scared of what I'll do to myself

Original Idea: I was a sweaty person even before the antidepressants but they made it so much worse, a heat wave and a meds mess-up is making it so much worse now. I'm so sick of dripping in sweat as soon as I move, makes my anxiety go nuts at work when I know I'm probably stinky due to this. 

I obviously use antiperspirant and deodorants, stay clean, try to stick to breathable clothing, I've used the likes of odaban as well as the maxi deodorants off shelf. I feel its beyond useless trying to talk to my GP about this again, not much available on the NHS either.

Original Idea: I just find it really difficult to make friends. Ever since I was younger I struggled with the social aspects of life much in thanks to my depression and anxiety. I still do my best to hang out with people, but I seem to give off depressing vibes to most because people usually don't care to call back. This has basically made the romantic side of life dryer than the Sahara Desert for me lol. I often try to ignore this and stay isolated, focus on work, studies you name it, but at the end of the day I just wish things could be different.

I'm in the same position a year before I am 20 now, and I'm feeling envious of others who are talking and having a good time socialising while I'm stuck in my head. It feels like I'm just going through this terrible life of mine till I die.

Original Idea: I’m 19 going into my sophomore year of college. I feel kind of miserable and lost in life. I feel guilty for feeling this way but I don’t know what to do.

I get nervous whenever I think about my future. For some reason, it’s like I can’t see myself being successful. Im not passionate about my current major and I feel like my motivation has gone down significantly. I honestly have no idea what I’m doing in my life and I feel completely behind everyone else. 

On top of that, I feel immense guilt for not having things figured out. I’m a first gen student and my parents have always expected me to have things figured out. I thought I did but now, I’m not sure. My parents have worked their asses off to give me this opportunity and I don’t want to let them down. I want to make them proud but I’m constantly battling my mental health and I just don’t know what to do.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!

Original Idea: Had this on and off rarely over years but it’s getting more common. I get this thing where I drink and water or whatever liquid I’m drinking gets stuck either in my throat or my chest. I’m choking or drowning. I’m gasping for breath. It’s so sudden and I jolt up gasping for air.it’s so scary. I can’t get breathe in or out and the liquid is choking me. Something then releases and I splutter the drink all over the place. I then feel like it’s slightly in my lungs but I’m not really coughing so it’s not like it’s gone down the wrong pipe. I am not asking for medical advice. just some advice and if anyone else gets it. My mum said she’s had it and calls it an air lock, she said I’ve sucked in air too quickly as I’ve drank. But I don’t  know, I didn’t feel like I did. I just had it now and it’s scared the hell out of me. I’ve been having trouble swallowing recently,I can’t eat and drink very well recently just had a normal barium swallow test so I just don’t know anymore. Please tell me there’s someone else who gets this. And what is it

It’s not every day, and it doesn’t seem tied to anything specific, but it catches me off guard each time. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

Original Idea: When I first took Lexapro, it started working after about two weeks, and I felt like a normal person. I had literally zero depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the medication stopped working (or weakened significantly) after about three to four weeks. I continued taking Lexapro for another three months, hoping I'd feel happy again, but unfortunately, I didn't. Did you find a medication that helped you long-term and cured you completely?

Original Idea: I get pretty shaky in my hands and arms when I am a very anxious, usually in a social situation such as giving a presentation or even just someone watching me perform a task with my hands.  I do the 4-4-4 breathing method, but it only helps a bit.  I'm not sure exactly how noticeable this shaking is to others, but when I look at my hand it is very noticeable to me.  I've heard meditation can help people with this, and I've been trying to do breathing mindfulness meditation for 10 minutes a day, but I haven't noticed a difference so far.  From what I understand, the reason I'm shaking is the "fight or flight" response which spikes adrenaline.  Does meditation actually lower this baseline (are there studies that prove this?), but mostly I want to know if any of you have personal experiences with shaking anxiety and meditation.

Original Idea: I was diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) a few months ago and started medication right after, I take Paxera 20 mg (Turkish medication, similar to Paxil) and I logged how it has changed my life for the better:


at first paxera turned me into an emotionless zombie. it felt as if my head was turned into concrete. i didn’t feel like myself at all. but i was also fine with it because the crazy anxiety attacks i used to have before medication was much much worse than feeling numb. other than my crippling anxiety, paxera also made me realize that i had an anger management problem. normally my mom would say shit that would turn me into a raging monster but during my first few days of paxera i found myself calmly explaining why the stuff my mom was saying was pissing me off. and she understood, said she’ll keep that in mind. normally i’d start yelling lol.  

then after like 5 days of switching to full dose i started feeling like myself again. i was making jokes and stuff. everything felt more lively, minus the anxiety. 

then i started working as a receptionist at this hotel. there was some minor bullying and hazing (some days my managers would really cross the line and straight up attack me) that would normally send me into an anxiety spiral, making me question my existence and shit lol. but i took em like a champ. i was very strong. i didn’t realize this at the time but now that i’m looking back, that shit would make me weep at night. in my head of course. i couldn’t cry before and paxera hasn’t made it any easier lol

aaand fast forward to now. the immense calming effects of paxera has definitely worn off. i’m happy about this as i didn’t like that i was literally gandhi at first lol. but those first few weeks opened my eyes about how my approach towards the outside world affects how i end up feeling as well. even though it’s not as easy anymore, i’m working to keep calm under situations that would normally send me into an anxiety spiral or cause me to get really mad and do things that aren’t very proactive to the problem at hand. i’m SO happy that i started medication man. it’s not a magic pill that fixes my problems, it’s a helping hand teaching me how to fix my problems myself. exactly how i wanted it to be, i was so scared that it was gonna be a “magic pill” lol i don’t want to be dependent on anything to be a functional person


I still feel anxiety. I still have to do breathing exercises every once in a while. I still get angry, wanting to lash out and relieve my overwhelming emotions without thinking. But Paxera has taught me that there is a better way to approach these problems.

I’m super grateful that I didn’t listen to people’s judgy opinions about antidepressants, medication is quite literally saving my life. I love who I’m turning into.

Original Idea: I (33F) have been diagnosed with iron deficiency couple months ago. Doc started medicine but my levels didn’t go higher as much as we wanted. So he referred me to a gastroenterologist.

Gastro doc ordered an endoscopy and colonoscopy tho he didn’t seemed worried and was kinda making sure if everything was ok. 
I had the procedure two weeks ago and now waiting for biopsy results. But other than my iron levels I had lost considerable amount of weight in the last months- tho I’ve been under tremendous amount of stress.

As I wait I started to think that I might have cancer that spread all over my body, I might be in the point of no return, even if endoscopy results are good, it might be in the other areas of my body like pancreas e.g. 
because of I think I have cancer, even tho maybe just anxiety I’ve started to develop back pain now, I don’t feel very well, don’t eat very well I even check my eyes out every couple hours to check if I have jaundice cause I read this is a sign of pancreatic issues. 

I tried to talk to ai but its advices are garbage.
I don’t have any friend or family I can share. Though im not looking for medical advice, I’m open for some ideas, ( I can’t watch shows or read books either as I’m too agitated) maybe hearing people who’ve been through similar processes can help me.

Original Idea: My birthday is on Friday, I’m turning 25, But I don’t want to be alive anymore. I’ve been struggling with severe panic disorder and ocd my entire life, and was diagnosed at 5 years old. Had a very traumatic and confusing childhood, was bullied, wanted friends so badly but could never keep one. Was always awkward, dumb, struggled with body image and weight, could only ever connect with people online because I have such debilitating anxiety. The only time I got attention is when guys want to have sex with me. I am pretty i will give myself that. But that’s it. I can’t keep a job for the life of me because of my anxiety. It feels like everything is falling apart. I think I’m supposed to die young. I just want this pain to end. I have no one and nothing. All there is suffering. I only love animals so much. The idea of them keeps me alive. When my rabbit passed in November I feel like I lost my entire heart. I just want to be with her again. 
I’m so sorry if this is annoying and too much. I just have no one to talk to and I feel so alone. I do want help and I want hope.

Original Idea: I am starting a new job soon , really big career shift, i was feeling anxious and wanted to secretly stop showing up, or that i get suddenly rejected, but now i believe in myself

i see the same embers that burned all of that opposition of self inflicted anxiety to ash, i see the darkness that will shroud me from the fake light that is my survival mode

my brain will not hamper me from experiencing new things, i will do it, and i will be scared, and will mess up, and will make mistakes, and will learn as well, the true meaning of life is suffering because you wouldn’t know the happy days if everything was going as expected and planned, it’s a growing pain, i have to learn how to dance in the rain, and when the rain goes through my umbrella unexpectedly, i will do my best to enjoy it

Original Idea: I've experimented with every "normal" practice journaling, breathing, meditation, you name it.

However, what is the one thing that never fails? I close my eyes, sit on the kitchen floor beside my refrigerator, and simply listen to the hum.

I have no idea why, but my mind stops talking after a few minutes.

What's YOUR odd, out-of-the-ordinary, or even mildly embarrassing trick that always works? I'm not passing judgment here. The stranger, the better. 💛

Original Idea: I have GAD and a immunodeficiency with perhaps Neuroinflammation. My problem is severe exhaustion, fatigue and tiredness. Most likely through the immunodeficiency.


Last Friday I started with 50mg and the morning and evening and immediately felt good, awake, with way less anxiety and motivated, fatigue was also gone.i could sleep, woke up early and was fit.

No sedation and my thinking was clear for the first time in 20 years. I also had no side effects first, but now it feels the full side effects kick in: 


Now after the first 5 days it feels like the full side effects kick in: Vertigo, headache, dizziness, gut problems and nausea.


I could cry, is this going to be better and back to the initial effect? I was wondering to get these side effects so late.

Original Idea: I don’t know if this happens to anyone else but recently I’ve been super anxious and paranoid when going outside even if it’s just for groceries. A few weeks ago I had my first panic attack which led me to calling an ambulance because I thought I was dying so now I’m anxious about having another panic attack. Has anyone got any tips for how to stay calm when they go outside or if they feel a panic attack coming?

Original Idea: When you have a mental health issue, do you go to a therapist first or a psychiatrist? I went to my primary care last year and had mental health screening and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, my PCP prescribed me zoloft and hydroxyzine, and honestly I haven't took any of those for months because I wanted to feel better without them, but recently (I guess with from many factors) my anxiety is back and is now taking my ability to work (that I constant want to leave from work) and secluded myself from others.

Last year I had a couple of sessions with a therapist but I didn't feel like I was liking it, and now I want to find one or maybe now better to go to a psychiatrist altogether? But I am not sure what do I need to do as a start? Ps: will they also provide me a doctor's note for my absence from work?

Original Idea: So I started having panic attacks randomly about two months ago, I kept coming back to the ER, then I got prescribed Ativan as needed which I took exactly as needed once every couple of days I’d take a .5mg for panic, I’d take one before doctor’s visits occasionally or else I’d panic. About 3 weeks ago ,I went in for an MRI which I couldn’t do because I would panic when they stuck me in the machine. That day I took 1mg Ativan and it didn’t help me much for the MRI. But after that I didn’t take an Ativan for about 10 days because I felt like I didn’t need to up until July 18th I took that 1mg Ativan and a day or two after I took a .5mg then for the next days I hadn’t taken an Ativan up until August 5th for a really really bad panic attack that day I took 1.5mg and since August 5th my panic attacks have gotten worse and I’ve increase my frequency in taking Ativan. Maybe a .5mg when I wake up and another near the time I go to sleep. So in summary for the past two months I’ve intermittently used benzos to stop panic attacks and since August 5th I’ve increased my intake of them, I’m fairly sure I have somewhat of a dependency on them which I’ll go through whatever withdrawal I don’t care, but I’m really really worried if I’ll have a seizure or possibly die from not using them anymore. I already skipped when I usually take them today  and feel okay just anxious about them causing a horrible health scare. Can I get some advice or some reassurance or anything? 

Edit: I’m sorry for bad formatting, I’m kinda going through it right now.

Original Idea: Hi I think I’ve developed severe anxiety over the past month and a half. I’m starting college in a couple of weeks, but I always feel like something bad will happen. It started with remembering some driving mistakes that I’ve made and ruminating on them. These days I can’t drive myself anymore. It’s gotten a lot worse to the point I’m obsessing over not electrocuting myself and recently I visited and had my first panic attacks when I stayed at an apartment on the 4th floor. In the apartment I was struggling a lot with intrusive thoughts. It’s like I was sooo close to jumping out of a window (call of the void) and hurting myself but I have no suicidal ideations. I’m Christian and reading the Bible helped me in this but I still felt REALLY weird toward those heights. I was scared I’d just snap and then hurt myself. I’d also ruminate about if I accidentally crossed a road wrong and got hit by a car. I’m back at home now but now I just keep thinking about all the times i could’ve died in the past couple years if something just went wrong. All of these are because of my own stupidity. Like I could’ve fallen asleep while driving bc I stayed up or drowned while intoxicated. it’s putting a lot of stress on me. I’d think of a past scenario and my heart starts racing and I’d get really thirsty and not want to leave my room. And I cant stop myself from thinking about it. I can’t live anymore without thinking abt something horrible

I plan on getting therapy/mental health help in college, but wanted to ask if anyone had any advice

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Hey all, I'm struggling with anxiety from change. Back at the beginning of this year, I started a new fully remote job. Thinking it was going to be great, it ended up being awful. It caused me severe anxiety from the isolation of wfh, and not feeling part of the team. I missed my old job that I was at for 3 years. I ended up on medications and eventually started feeling better.

Now, I just started another new job that is hybrid. Learning from the last time, I came into this one with caution; just starting slow and not having any sort of expectations. However, I'm finding myself struggling with anxiety again. This first week Im remote, and the isolation is awful. Due to the nature of the work, I don't believe I'm allowed to work from a public area like a coffee shop, or else I'd love to.

A few years ago I suffered severe anxiety after moving, twice. One year after another. I moved, and then anxiety would sink in. 

Another example is when my wife and I went to Europe for three weeks. I was anxious basically the entire time, especially in the countries where English isn't the native language. I felt very nervous and fearful about the unfamiliar surroundings.

I'm noticing a pattern here that I get severe anxiety from change and unfamiliarity. It makes me nervous about the rest of my life, because change and unfamiliar surroundings is part of life. Change of job, moving, vacationing somewhere new, etc.

Does anyone else experience this? If so, how do you deal with it?

Original Idea: 


So I know muscle soreness is normal after working out and I used to workout so I know what that feels like. I actually stopped working out 3 years ago because of my muscle tightness.

I really love working out but after working out I get muscle soreness on the right side of my body and I don’t know why and how to fix it. I’ve been working out like 5 weeks and the pains just getting worse.

If I workout it’s like the whole of my body is extremely tight and it’s literally from neck to my toes. I don’t workout my legs but after working out my right leg is extremely tight. My fingers are tight even my toes. 

I can’t really find anything online so no idea what it is. If I’m sitting down or laying I feel discomfort and tightness but if I move or I’m moving it feels like I’ve pulled a muscle and the pain in sharper.

It’s always the right side and just no idea what to do it’s giving me so much distress. My left side feels completely normal.

Now the only two things I think it might be is maybe a back issue like disc issues or maybe anxiety I have high anxiety which does cause me to have more tight muscles. 

Any ideas what this could be can anyone relate and how is this fixable. I have gone to the doctors and physios but here in UK they’re never thorough so they’ll tried to give me some stretches and pills but don’t actually investigate it unless I have had an accident or if I go private health care.

Original Idea: Does anyone else find it almost impossible to study when anxiety from other parts of life is overwhelming? I keep wondering if I’m just undisciplined, or if this is what happens when stress takes over.

I’m a uni student with ADHD and on the path to become a doctor(fingers crossed). In high school I could procrastinate and still get top grades, but university hit me hard. Without structure, my habits caught up to me, my grades dropped, and I eventually got an ADHD diagnosis in third year. It took me so long to realize I even had ADHD because mental health is so stigmatized in my family and even when I had to get help I had to go at it alone because I know my mom wouldn't be supportive. The diagnosis helped me understand myself, but I felt like I’d already lost so much time and confidence.

The MCAT has been my biggest hurdle. It's recommended to take it the summer after second year and so I booked it even though I knew I wasn't ready since I hadn't treated my ADHD yet but the pressure from my mom made me book it anyway. I ended up doing bad as expected but I had hope I could do better the next year. Third year I did a lot better in school, as I finally had medication for ADHD and so for the summer after third year,  I planned to study in my university town where I focus better, but couldn’t get a job to stay there for the summer, so I came home. Home is stressful, my parents always fight, and my mom is going through a major financial loss. I feel guilty leaving her alone in an unhappy home and the was a major part of why I came home for the summer as well, but being here makes it so much harder to study. I began this year's studying attempt with so much more confidence and even took a diagnostic which showed me that I had a good grasp on the content even before studying but I should've realized that I need structure and I can't study for something this content heavy and practice heavy when I'm anxious about other things. Even on medication of ADHD, I can only manage small bursts of studying, and the rest of the time my head is full of worries about my family, money, and my future. This anxiety leads me to a hopelessness that tells me there's no point in anything and that I should just give up. Without motivation I get no where with my studying and end up in a shame spiral that tells me I'm not smart enough for this and that I haven't worked enough for anything and that I deserve nothing.

My test is next week, and I’m nowhere near ready. I feel stuck, ashamed, and scared I’ve ruined my chances. I want this career badly, but anxiety has made it hard to even start, and guilt makes me feel like I'm never going to be cut out for this. I've already wasted so much time on this one test and it truly has demoralized so much.

If you’ve been through this , when outside stress makes studying feel impossible,  how did you handle it? How did you know you weren’t just lazy, and that you *did* want it badly enough?

Original Idea: hi all, i have a couple more questions for my zoloft friends. the past year or so i feel like im going crazy, zoloft helped with my anxiety, but i feel like it gave me so many more problems. please let me know if you have experienced any of this or if im making it up! 
to start, i feel overly compulsive- which i never was. now i have ocd tendencies like locking the door multiple times, or needing things my way or no way, i have severe overstimulation and irritability. the overstimulation is the main part because i never experienced it but minor things will set me off. i have little to no sex drive, i don’t even want to kiss my partner because the feeling of saliva on my lips overstimulates me. i’m so so so lazy, i can sleep for 24hrs straight if i wanted to, i have zero motivation to do anything. whether it’s going to the store or even reading an email, anything that requires the least bit of effort i don’t want to do (and i wont because i simply don’t have the capacity to care.) i want to get off of zoloft to see if it’s really me or the medication doing it. my biggest fear is that it’s me all along and i wont know how to fix it.

Original Idea: Hoping to get some feedback from people with lived experiences. 

I was in citalopram (celexa) for 6 years. I noticed lately, it was giving me headaches, making me groggy/sleepy during the day and it decreased my libido significantly (especially as of late). My doctor suggested I taper off and switch to Buspirone, an anxiolytic. I gradually tapered the citalopram, for almost 2 months and started the Buspirone only after my tapering was done. 

I have been on buspirone for about 6 weeks now, and suddenly I've started to feel physical symptoms of anxiety come back (excessive rumination to the point of not being able to focus on anything else, feeling of panic in stomach for no reason all the time). I am wondering if this is a delayed SSRI discontinuation syndrome, OR if my anxiety symptoms are just coming back, which means the Buspirone may not be helping much (gives me RLS at night too, and I have trouble falling asleep). I've noticed myself relying a bit too much on alcohol to calm my panic/anxiety over the last week or so.

I am also trying to take a break from THC, which could have something to do with all of this. 

Any feedback would be good. My pharmacist recommended maybe I get on Wellbutrin.

Original Idea: I’m 23 and honestly struggling a lot with feelings of not truly belonging to any of my friend groups. On paper, things are great: I have amazing friends, I’ve recently moved in with one of my best friends, I just got a pay rise, and my flat is beautiful. But despite all of this, I feel miserable and I can’t figure out why.

Here’s the situation: I know a lot of different people, and I get invited to everything, but it often feels like I’m always “joining in” rather than being part of an established group. There are pre-existing friend groups from university, living situations, or just people naturally gravitating toward each other, and I feel like I’m always coming into the middle of things.

Some examples: the guys from work have a group chat I’m not part of, and a new friend group I’ve formed over the past six months has a “house chat” that I’m not in , not because they dislike me, but because the chat is specifically for people living together. I know logically that none of this is personal, but it still hits me really hard.

I’ve also left some groups or fallen out with people in the past because they weren’t very nice, and seeing their friendship solidified without me makes me feel even more like an outsider. Even when friends tell me they love me and want me around, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just “joining” rather than belonging.

I’m worried I’m overthinking and that these feelings might start to affect my friendships. I just don’t understand why I can’t feel like I truly fit in, even when everything looks fine on the surface. Why do I feel like this, and how can I stop overthinking and start feeling like I belong?

Thanks for reading any advice or insight would mean a lot.

Original Idea: Has anyone else experienced constant fear and panic that makes you feel like you’re going to die? Lately, my anxiety has skyrocketed, and it feels like it’s taken over my life. I’m constantly pacing, feeling dizzy, lightheaded, spaced out, fatigued, and weak. Overall, I just don’t feel well.

I tend to feel a little better by the end of the day, but mornings are the worst. I wake up with an overwhelming fear that I’m dying, and it’s completely disrupted my daily life. I can’t focus, get things done, or enjoy anything.

I feel so alone in this, and I just need to hear from someone who’s been through this and made it to the other side. I’m truly at my wit’s end

Original Idea: I recently started taking sertraline almost a week ago, and my anxiety has gotten so much worse to the point where I’ve thrown up because of it. I’m constantly having an anxiety attack, am nauseous, and having stomach problems. 

How do I deal with this? Is there any way to make it better?

(Add on: I’ve recently started in a new school, so my level of anxiety was high to begin with, but it’s never been as bad as it is right now)

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I 19F have moved from my hometown to another country with my family and will start fashion school in a few weeks. The thought of being so far away from my city makes me so anxious and sad. I can’t even think about it because if I do I tear up. 
My best friend will start uni in another city too but she moved in with her childhood friend.
My other best friend is still in my hometown and will try to get a job there.
All the people I know have moved from home and started to take responsibilities and make decisions for their future. But I feel so overwhelmed with the changes and I am scared that I won’t like this new life here and that I will waste my younger years feeling sad and missing home. I will study 4 years in this town and after that I will move back home hopefully.
I am scared that I wont make any friends here and that I will be all alone. The people in this school are very different from the people I usually hang out with but we do share a common interest : fashion design; but what if I don’t find a friend in that new university. Also I really want to move out and start my own life because I still feel like a child when I am home and I want to be adult and independent.
I feel like I am missing out on my own life. I also feel anxious because I have never had a boyfriend and I am afraid I won’t meet anyone and be all alone. This anxiety makes me so tired and keeps me up at night.
Has anyone had a similar experience or felt similar feelings ?

Original Idea: Hi guys. I’m adjusting to an ssri Zoloft for the second time and I’m on 50mg week 4. But I’m having the worst panic attack right now than I’ve ever had before. I feel hot and cold and like my blood is on fire but my hands and feet are cold. I’m drenched in sweat. I feel light headed and wobbly. I’m shaking. It’s hard to breathe and my chest feels uncomfortable. Every muscle in my body is tight. And it’s lasted almost 2 hours now. What do I do? Can anyone give me some reassurance or experiences of your own that sound similar? I’m really struggling

Original Idea: hello all! i’ve been on zoloft for about 2 years or 1.5 yrs. i started on 50, then a couple months later went on 75, a couple months after that back down to 50, and decided it was doing more harm than good and i wanted to fully get off of them. i stayed on 50 for a while and then dropped down to 25 and have been on those for maybe 2-3 months. i noticed the occasional vertigo as i dropped down the first week but nothing other than that. i ran out of my 25mg and the doctor has yet to contact me back about a refill and i have been off of them for about 3 days. i’m not noticing anything crazy besides the very very slight, almost nonexistent vertigo. i have a couple questions. 1.) will i be okay health wise if i decide to not take any again. 2.) how long will the side effects last, and what are they? i dont know because ive only been on them for about 2 years and ive been on 25 for months. 3.) should i get a refill or see how i feel, will it damage me to decide i cant do withdrawal by myself and take a pill? i’m more nervous seeing all the side effects people talk about, is it a one size fits all or everyone reacts different? i really really want off but if the withdrawal gets severe is it okay to take one or will it damage anything? i’ve been meaning to set up an appointment and discuss a tapering but they haven’t gotten back to me in 3 days. thanks for the help guys

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I’m sure this question has been asked multiple times, but how do y’all stop overthinking/over-dissecting text conversations when no one said anything wrong?

For context, my boyfriend met a guy not long ago and they have been clicking. I’ve seen this guy twice and the vibes are great. Now, my boyfriend is moving abroad so I’m in this anxious state looking for new friends and new connections. So I’m anxious/nervous that once my boyfriend leaves, this new guy won’t want to be my friend given that he connected with my boyfriend first. 

I find myself asking my boyfriend all the time “has he texted you? Have yall spoken?”  He shows me the messages, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong/weird, but I’ll overthink and dissect every single message. This will be in my head for 2-3-4 days and it’s the only thing I can think about. Why did he say this, why this emoji, interesting that he messaged after X hours of not talking, etc etc. 

I know that I can’t control how this guy will feel towards me once my bf leaves. I also know that this guy has a life before and will have a life after. But my brain can’t stop thinking and overthinking about all the possible scenarios. Will he be my friend? Can I invite him to so and so event? Will he ghost me?

Original Idea: A lot of advice online seems to advise emphasizing that you are struggling and such but I do not think that would be a good approach with my parents. I do not think they would take it particularly seriously and, if they did, it wouldn't help much beyond making them worried and when my parents become worried, they tend to take it out on me and it's very difficult to achieve anything productive. 

What are some more casual explanations or benefits that I could maybe cite as a reason for seeking therapy? I considered just talking about self-improvement and how it might help me do better in school but I don't think that alone is enough to justify the cost of therapy.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I don’t even know where to go with this since I can’t afford therapy or anything.
I have severe anxiety and fear of failure and it’s absolutely ruining my life in every way shape and form. 
I have severe fear of failure, I’m in a tech related major and the job market is complete rubbish. I’m feeling like an imposter more and more every single day, I feel like the bar has been set so incredibly high now due to AI and I NEED to improve my technical skills but I’m completely frozen. I’m graduating next year and I havent done any internships and feel like I’m completely done for. If you think I’m overthinking this and secretly an A+ student, I promise you I am not. This is taking over my life. The panic, the failure, the comparing myself to my peers, the severe insomnia I have now because I stay up all night thinking about this until my body is physically exhausted and I have to fall asleep, the wanting to learn everything but learning absolutely nothing with no clear roadmap. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I had an interview today as well and my face started becoming very hot down to my neck and back while the rest of my body was freezing, and when the interview ended I looked down at my knees and thighs to find them all scratched up and bleeding. Please believe me when I say I had absolutely no idea I was doing this the whole interview!! I was unintentionally harming myself physically without even noticing and using my body as a stress toy. This is how bad it’s gotten. My nervous system is out of whack. My head is all over the place.
Not to mention the lovely physical effects anxiety has on you: 
- Nausea 
- Severe gagging
- Hot flashes and sweating on some body parts while others are freezing cold.
- Literally feeling like my lungs have collapsed because I can’t breathe.
- Racing thoughts that literally attack your brain and severe insomnia.
- Hands always shaking hard it almost looks like I have Parkinsons.

Original Idea: 2 nights ago I got really anxious because I was having worse heart palpitations than usual and ended up in the hospital which made me even more anxious. All my tests (Bloods and EKG) were normal and only my heart rate was high due to being so scared. 

I signed myself out because I felt my heart rate would drop more at home and it did after a while but I’m still constantly checking myself and being scared about my heart. 

I spoke to my GP and he told me it’s most likely anxiety and that it’s a very low chance I have a heart related problem. Even with all the reassurance from doctors I’m still so anxious and I feel like I’m on my own. My Apple Watch is making me check everything constantly like ECG and heart rate and it comes back normal every time but the ECG looks different than others using the same watch. 

I just want to know that I’m not on my own with this 😭

Original Idea: I’ve been on Lexapro 10 years but it’s just not effective anymore. I’m having a lot of physical anxiety, more so than mental. I started my cross taper per my doctors instructions drop from 20mg to 10mg Lexapro and start 20mg Prozac. I’m on day 6 and panicky feelings have started. And Ativan isn’t helping. Just looking for some hope that this is normal and will pass?

Original Idea: Hi all. I’ve just started Buspirone and I’m tapering up, currently only on one tablet a day. Trouble is it’s making me feel super sleepy after taking. Whilst this wouldn’t be the worst side effect to have, I already suffer with chronic fatigue syndrome so this is less than ideal.

Does anyone know if this side effect dissipates or is this likely to continue?

Original Idea: My heart was racing so hard yesterday that I felt like I would never be able to breathe again. I discovered something so strange at that very moment that I nearly burst out laughing.

I reached for a tiny toy I always carry in my pocket—one of those flexible little cubes—and, rather than concentrating on the panic, I simply pressed, stretched, and folded it. This instantly brought me back to the present.

In a matter of seconds, my breathing slowed. It worked even though it didn't make sense.

When anxiety strikes, little things like that can occasionally be the most effective lifelines.

What strange little trick does it work for you? Come on, let's share. Perhaps we can support one another in escaping our next panic attack.

(This is a secure environment; you don't need to use this coping mechanism.)

Original Idea: A few days ago maybe even a week ago I tried shrooms ontop of my ketamine therapy even a tad of cannabis, I wasn’t able to eat or drink for days until yesterday when I finally was able to drink fluids. 
Long story short I feel like I’m going insane, my phone and thoughts were a bit distorted and the little bit of sleep I got last night resulted in a terrible dream night mare that I couldn’t get out of even tho I knew it had to be a dream. 
I just really hope that I’m not losing my mind or set back my panic disorders that bad. 
I just hate feeling like I’m going crazy. I almost much rather the physical symptoms of anxiety. 
I’m not sure what to do

Original Idea: i was on generic lexapro (escitalipram oxilate i think) and i and now weaned off it, because it wasn’t doing anything for my social anxiety or ocd or depressive episodes, so basically i was taking a medication for fun 😒. now a month after being weaned, i don’t want to go back on an ssri because of the SWEATS. but also i feel like i am mentally strong enough to deal with my thoughts. but here’s my issue. my physical anxiety symptoms have come back. i wake up short of breath, not because of an actual health reason, im just ALREADY filled with anxiety. i’m shaking like a crusty little dog. i’m so nauseas and have trouble eating because i have no appetite when im anxious. i’m going to get blood work and then revisit my doctor and ask what her opinions are on beta blockers. just want some experiences and advice before i go, anything helps.

Original Idea: Hello, I'm posting this in hopes to get some advice or get some insight on how others deal with this. I obviously have anxiety, have for as long as I can remember. It's always greatly affected my digestive system but it's been really bad lately. I live in an environment where I'm constantly anxious and don't feel comfortable in my own home (living with family am i right? 🥲) And I'm almost always experiencing stomach pains so bad that it prevents me from sleeping and I'm just always feeling unwell. 

Unfortunately I'm not in a position where I can leave the environment I live in. I'm in therapy, I go on walks very regularly to get out of the house and of course exercise is so helpful with anxiety and just in general. I'm trying to ease my anxieties the best I can. But I have so many surrounding factors that are working against me and my health. 

Ultimately I'm just feeling really helpless in the matter and any knowledge or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you're doing well ❤️

Original Idea: I’m transferring to a new university to finish my bachelors but I don’t know anyone at the school and I’m super anxious about starting at a new place. I’ve registered to attend some events during welcome week but they are a week away and I’m already a wreck about it. I’m living in a house off campus so I don’t have a roommate to go with and I am already feeling to anxious to go to these events alone. What if no one wants to talk to me? What if I’m the only person that shows up alone? Ugh I hate it but I don’t not want to make friends. I had a lot of good friends at my previous university, I don’t know why I’m so on edge about it now, I want to throw up just thinking about it. Any help for transferring students?

Original Idea: So I am M26 and have been living with anxiety/DPDR since I was young. While the panic attacks and DPDR episodes have been sort of up and down since I was about 17 with some weeks/months/years being better or worse than others, I’d say I have at the very least gained a much better understanding of it than I used to have. I’ve been in working in retail/customer service since I was 18 (which probably hasn’t helped much but it’s all I’m qualified to do). 

There have been a few careers over the years that I’ve at least been interested in if not full on wanted to try. But I swear every time I even mention it online even if it’s just something as simple as “I’m interested in (X) and looking for advice” and people find out I have a history of anxiety or depression, all the responses I get are negative to the point that I don’t even want to mention it anymore because people just ruin it. 

“I’m interested in becoming an EMT” “don’t do it, you won’t be able to take care of people”

“Im interested in joining the military” “why would you want to join if you’re anxious and depressed? You would just be a liability”

“Im interested in volunteering in conflict zones”
“Just send money, you would do more harm than good because of your mental state”

Like okay I get it, I have issues. Is it so hard to believe that MAYBE I might be able to overcome them and do something with my life? Sorry never mind, I’ll just stay in retail for the rest of my life because according to basically everyone I’m too weak or damaged to do anything worthwhile. This shit makes me want to walk off into the woods and never talk to people again. Sorry for the rant, just tired of it.

Original Idea: It started with a simple plan: gather the sources I need for my project.
Now I’m drowning in them.

Every time I try to organize, my brain freezes. My chest tightens. There’s this restless, buzzing energy under my skin, like I need to do something, but I can’t stick with it long enough to make progress.

I’m diagnosed with OCD and ADHD, and I can’t tell if this is one, the other, or both — but I feel like I’m about to explode. I’ve already collected all the information I need (maybe too much), but the moment I try to sort it, I get stuck.

It’s exhausting and frustrating, and I don’t know how to push through this mix of overwhelm, anxiety, and restlessness without burning out.

Has anyone experienced this? How do you actually get your work organized when your brain is fighting you every step of the way?

Original Idea: Since I've been sa'd multiple times in my life, I've developed anxiety about going out, being around men,etc... 

But it honestly sucks so much cuz it sometimes ruin my life and I've talked about it to a friend who told me that I have to fix this issue if I wanna live normally. And I do want that. I wanna stop living in fear and anxiety.

However, I don't see how I could stop being anxious over these stuff since there are so many chances that what I've been through would happen again. Not being anxious over a danger that exists it's just impossible to me. It's like being told that you should stop being afraid of lions while being in the middle of a cage of hungry felines.
Idk if that makes sense..

Original Idea: Man whenever my anxiety starts popping up it always does so by disrupting my sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night heart racing, covered in sweat, and feel like I could just explode with how restless I get. I think the hardest part is knowing I need the rest and not being about to get it which in turn makes me more anxious. I always fall asleep easily and during the day most of the time I feel better but man oh man I struggle when I wake up in the night. How about y’all anyone else deal with something similar? I’ve gone whole nights just getting like a couple hours of sleep before and then have to wake up and get on with my day which isn’t fun but it’s nice to know I can get through my days even with a lack of sleep

Original Idea: I've tried several times and it always feels like if anything the effectiveness is *reduced*, let alone faster acting.

So much so , that I feel like they must be designed like that as a safety feature for preventing a misuse of the prescription, i.e. tablet for oral use only. Whereas there are other forms of the drug for different administration.

I've tried leaving it in and not swallowing for as long as fifteen minutes and it seems like there is residue that doesn't dissolve, which, maybe there's other ingredients (or the active one) that don't absorb through bodily linings.

Original Idea: Night time, specifically after sundown, my anxiety really spikes. Every sound makes me jump, I see things in shadows, I won’t walk into a room with the lights off. I have to sleep with a nightlight. If my girlfriend falls asleep before me it’s basically game over, I can’t sleep (i write this as she is asleep). I’m a grown adult but I feel like a child and like I’m crazy. I mean genuinely I’m hearing and seeing things that aren’t there, I’m scared of closets and leaving the bedroom door open. I’m terrified someone will break in and kill us. I don’t know what to do. Most nights my girlfriend will try and soothe me enough to sleep but this is so embarrassing to have to do as an adult. What can I do?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I've been like this all day. Basically here is an explaination:

I have this friend, who is deeply suicidal. The thing is, he doesn't want help, doesn't care for it. And says he will kill himself. And that, there is no changing his mind.

I have even suggested medication, but he doesn't want it. He has intrusive thoughts just like me, I have OCD so I know how hard it is. And I know meds do genuienly help. But he genuienly doesn't want it.

There was a converstation we had yesterday which, I don't know if I said something wrong, or if I did something wrong. Please let me know.

All this started when I suggested antidepresants, because it does help me. He said no, and that, he didn't want his brain to be "altered by meds". Which. Felt really invalidating. Like genuienly. I didn't dwell on it tho. Due to his situation.

He has been saying that death is his only way out and that, there is no world he lives for long, stuff like that. The thing is, I have experienced the loss of a family and this triggers me bad.

It kind of made me snap in the moment and I asked why he isn't even considering other solutions. Like I wanted an explaination at this point. 

I also told him how much I cared and how I could not handle loss of another person after the first one, and thats was the reason why I was suggesting this.

He explained why, how much he hated everything, and more. And he has all the right to hate everything, with all that's he's been through.

I tried to do more comforting. Which, I think it fell on deaf ears. Like how I would be there for him and care. And would do anything to help, and try to keep him alive.

But he said that it would be ok and we would both be ok.

I was crying at this point, like full on bawling. Idk if what I did was wrong but I told him I wouldn't be ok if he died. I said I was barely even ok when I experienced the last loss, and even tiny details from it. And now that I'm all grown up, knowing this and not being able to prevent it would kill me. I genuienly poured my heart out. To try and show him how much I care.

Then he apologized for even befriending me in the first place while knowing that he would not live for long. But one thing he said that tipped me off was "if you truly mean what you say" which again, made me feel invalidated, due to how much events in my life have effected me.

I ignored it though, but now thinking back, it genuienly stings, but I also dont blame him because he is convinced that everything could easily be a simulation. He suffers from derealization aswell, so it's understandable.

After that I just told him to never say that he shouldn't have befriended me and that, he is the most amazing person I've ever met.

After that convo ended shortly. I havent been able to properly calm down and its been a day. I don't know if I said something wrong, but I also feel kinda angry and take this with the grain of salt:

I'm genuienly angry at him for telling me that someday he will kill himself. And that, he won't seek help. I don't get why he is telling me this. To make it easier on me? That makes it way harder. Knowing and not being able to help. I genuienly can't cope with this while he is alive, let alone if he dies, what would I even do with myself? I would never live with the guilt. It's like I'm put under pressure where I can't do anything to stop it. I want to help but can't, and if he won't accept help then I can't help. I can't just say I'm fine with it because I can't just be an accomplice im this progressing suicide. I genuienly feel so stuck.  

What can I even do? I don't know and I just need help badly at this point. Does anyone have any advice?

Original Idea: Do you ever stop wondering if you’re just trying to make someone like you or actually being nice? Do you ever stop wondering if you’re being a bad friend or just putting yourself first? Do you ever stop wanting to reach out to everyone you know for validation? Do you ever figure out when you’re seeking validation or just seeking a conversation? I know this is a lot, but there’s a lot in my mind. I just want to know if this is how it will be forever, or if there’s something I can do to change it.

Original Idea: I’ve been exploring different ways to manage my anxiety beyond my usual routine, like mindfulness and exercise. Recently, a friend mentioned a place called Green Dragon that they found relaxing, but I haven’t been to any space like that before.

I’m **not** asking where to buy anything or for medical advice ,  just curious if visiting certain environments or wellness spaces has helped you feel calmer or less anxious.

What kinds of places or atmospheres have made a difference for you?

Original Idea: After school one day, I had to read an essay I wrote. I was a new student, usually a good student in class, but anxiety has always been part of my life.

When the teacher called me, I stood up and started reading. I was trembling so much that I could barely make a sound. My breathing got heavy, and everything on my paper started to blur. I couldn’t focus, my eyes couldn’t see clearly.

Eventually, I had to stop and tell the teacher I couldn’t continue. I went back to my seat. That day is probably one of the most embarrassing moments of my life.

Original Idea: Anxiety can sometimes be a healthy warning that makes you take action or defend yourself, and other times it can be an overload that drains your energy and keeps you thinking about the same things over and over. What distinguishes them from one another? And have you ever had the experience of anxiety empowering you instead of destroying you? Talk about your experience and suggestions.

Original Idea: 



Hey friends,
I want to talk about something I’ve been learning that’s helped me a LOT. Bracing.  

Bracing is when your body stays tight without you even realizing it—shoulders up, jaw clenched, stomach held in, etc. For many neurodivergent people (including autistic and ADHD folks), this isn’t just about stress or anxiety. It’s something our bodies do automatically to feel “ready” for the world. The problem is if you stay braced too long, it wears you out, makes pain worse, and can mess with how you move.

What to try:
	•	Notice your shoulders. Are they up by your ears? Gently let them drop.
	•	Put your hand on your belly. Can you take a slow breath without lifting your chest?
	•	Check your jaw. Is it tight? Try resting your tongue on the roof of your mouth but keep it soft.

This isn’t about “fixing” your posture or being perfect.  It's about giving your body a break from constant tension. Small changes, practiced often, can make a big difference over time.

Have you noticed yourself bracing? What helps you release it?

Original Idea: So for context; I went to visit one of my longtime best friends out of state for 5 days. I tend to feel anxious when I’ve been around people for too long and I haven’t had my time to decompress but I figured this would be fine as she’s my best friend and she tends to fill my cup. I left on the 7th. 

I’m not sure if this is just exacerbated anxiety but I’ve felt very weird ever since the 10th and it’s gotten worse since. It feels like after drinking anxiety/disassociation but also very different, because I didn’t really drink liquor and even when I do drink too much wine it’s not nearly this intense. It became kinda difficult to even share excitement or feel genuinely happy a few days in, it felt like my nervous system was malfunctioning. 

Internally I feel detached from my body and trapped in it at the same time. I was relying on the familiarness of streets or my childhood neighborhood to ground me but everything felt really strange yesterday when I got home. As if I didn’t 100% recognize my surroundings, like I was in an alternate reality somehow, something was just off. I just looked it up and it sounds like derealization? It also feels really overwhelming right now for me to talk to or be around anyone, even the people that normally ground me. I’m not suicidal but these feelings lead me to feel like it’s very hard to live in this state and it’s hard to feel like I’m ever going to return to normal. I honestly just want to shut myself in my room for days, I don’t feel like I can handle anything more. 

I know this cant be normal but I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt like this? It feels like there’s something deeply wrong with me and I think it’s only contributing to these feelings idk.

Original Idea: I'm a high school senior, and I've never felt more anxious and worried in my entire life.

I was very lazy throughout high school, and my grades suffered because of it, it wasn't until the second semester of my Junior year until I started really caring about school. My obsession over looking at college stats and comparing myself to successful people in fields I'm interested in (business, law, and politics) has taken over my life.

I've lost hours of time looking up researching every single person I see in a Financial Times or Bloomberg video or podcast to see where they went to college. I've researched tens of politicians seeing where they went. I've spent hours and hours just looking up average GPAs and SATs and being on LinkedIn looking for everyone's college.

This has taken over my life, and I've never felt so down on myself and hopeless before, but simultaneously, fearful of my future.

I feel like I'll never be enough.

Original Idea: I am supposed to go on a trip today that involves a 5 hour car ride (by myself), then 3 hour drive tomorrow to the beach. I have been anxious about it for weeks. What specifically makes me anxious? Driving, being out of my home, sharing a room with others/insomnia, figuring out parking, eating restaurant/boardwalk food for a week, being away from my husband, getting too much sun. Positives? seeing family and friends. I am crying scared, but feel like I can't let my anxiety "win". So here I sit.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Two years ago (2023), I (19M) moved to Toronto for uni.
That’s when I became the villain in my own story.

Before I left, I had this girl. She was a year younger — still in high school while I was starting uni. She gave me her whole heart, trusted me, showed me to her parents, and loved me in a way I’ll never get again.

I loved her too. But I was terrified.
Terrified of doing long distance.
Terrified she’d hook up with other guys while when she goes to uni while 
I sat in my dorm miserable. Plus I had only 1 year of dorms, while she had 4. 

So my brain came up with the dumbest “solution” ever:
If she ever does it… I’ll do it first. We’ll be even.

Petty. Insecure. Cowardly.
And I went through with it.

The second I got to uni, I started hooking up with other girls. Part of me was scared of leaving dorms as a loser. Part of me didn’t want to be the sad ex while she was out living her best life.

Meanwhile, she was in school, crying at night, going through hell. She’d still call me saying she missed me, and I’d comfort her… while knowing what I was doing behind her back.

The more I hooked up, the shittier I felt. Eventually, the flings ended. I went back to just talking to her, pretending nothing happened. We weren’t “official,” but we acted like we were. I even got jealous over other guys. Somehow, I went back home after 1st year and I was in a 3 month situationshop with her and broke up after she went to uni. She went to uni and treated me like absolute shit. I was w other girls but I made time to talk to her, but she never even spoke to me and had no clue what she was doing in uni. But no this trauma bond always had us coming back to each other and had me accepting this was more of karma’s play.

Fast forward: Valentine’s Day 2025. We get back together. I still keep the secret. She continued to treat me badly. I’d cry for hours,  it would ruin my social friendships, I went into heavy marjuana abuse, worst of all I took it. “This is my karma,” I told myself.

Then one day, I cracked. I told her — no details, just that I’d been with other girls.
That was it. Second chance gone.

What I did was wrong.
But I swear, I would do anything to give this girl the comfort and happiness she deserves. When I went back home a month ago, I was on my knees for her, trying to be the best man I could be one last time. She made memories with me, spent time with me, but made it clear she didn’t want a relationship w me again. At presence, I was the best to her, postive thinking, everything to be her ideal man but I was still kinda being treated weird. And I just let that walk over me in the name of “oh don’t react, it’s ur karma”. Idk why i punish myself like this and keep myself in this trauma bond.

I’m proud of her.
But I’m scared of myself.

Because my ex gave me everything… and I destroyed her home.
I made her cry so many nights.
And now I live with the fear that karma is just waiting to take away anyone I ever love again.

Call it trauma-induced behavior. Call it self-sabotage. I call it the biggest mistake of my life. st year.  Therapy is so expensive for me, I’ve called hotlines to prevent self harm, I’ve cried, I don’t ever wanna hurt anyone like this ever again, I don’t wanna live a lie again. But I need help, I need advice from someone who’s been in similar situations. How did anyone stop self sabotage, negativity, negative voices in their head, social anxiety, jealousy, insecurity, low self esteem. Man there’s sm and therapy is so fucking expensive 

TL;DR: 
I (19M) had a loving girlfriend a year younger than me before moving to uni in 2023. Out of fear she’d eventually hook up with other guys, I started hooking up with girls first to “be even.” She spent that year crying and struggling while I betrayed her. We stayed in a toxic on-and-off “trauma bond,” and when we finally got back together on Valentine’s Day 2025, I eventually confessed (without details). She left. Now I live with crushing guilt, anxiety, and self-sabotage — therapy is expensive, and I’m looking for advice on breaking the cycle of insecurity, jealousy, and low self-esteem.

Original Idea: I'm currently in a panic attack as I write this. And, it's hard to explain but, I know there's more I can do to help myself but my brain just.. won't let me. All it's letting me do is listen to music and play video games. But, it won't let me do other things that could help me like breathing, self care, grounding, etc. I feel paralyzed. Like on the one hand, I want to get rid of this panic attack so I can sleep. On the other hand I feel like I deserve this. Like if I calm down "too quick" I'm just faking it, and as if it's logical to be in a panic attack since people keep saying it's things I SHOULD be anxious about (the current US political climate). Like its insensitive to calm down. 

Idk if this is just some weird form of self harm or what but... Does anyone else get this? What should I do about it?

Original Idea: I just got my permit and I’m practicing driving right now, this is my 2nd time driving and I almost crashed the car on a turn, thankfully the truck I was driving in was sturdy and didn’t scratch or mess up the car. My legs feel shaky even though I drove me and my moms boyfriend (he’s teaching me) back home slowly, I know I shouldn’t feel this way but it keeps replaying in my mind. All was going well and now I feel like I messed up this image of me in my moms boyfriends mind of being a decent starter. I always want to look good in peoples eyes deep down which makes it 10x harder for me to get over things I mess up on.

Original Idea: a vent since i feel like such a failure. i interned at a company this summer-- I like the environment, my supervisor, my coworkers, and the work I was doing. everything was going good throughout the past 11 weeks I was there, and aside from some anxiety the first day, everything was going off without a hitch. for context, I've been on anxiety meds since I had somewhat of a mental breakdown in January 2021. I've been taking 20 mg of prozac since, but eventually weened off years later this january with doctor's approval. the past few months without the meds have been fine. i felt anxiety at times from school, starting a new job, and family stuff, but nothing I couldn't manage.

everything went to shit two weeks ago. i randomly had a panic attack after years of not having one for years, and it caused me to absolutely spiral and lose my shit. i ended up taking 4 sick days off from work (I lied that I caught an illness) simply because I couldnt do anything else than lay in bed, shake, and vomit from the anxiety. i mustered up the will to go back to work and had to take multiple antihistamines a day to keep me sedated enough to not have a panic attack in the office. i ended up leveling out my emotions after a week and felt almost back to normal. unfortunately, I actually caught a cold this past friday and it caused me to spiral yet again into a huge mess of anxiety. anyways, I forced myself to go to work Monday and Tuesday despite not sleeping for the past 48 hours from having panic attacks and vomiting. however, after yet another sleepless night, I  decided that I just can't go to work anymore. i just messaged my supervisor that I need to resign today, a week early from my end date, due to a medical emergency. i just got off the phone with him (where I was holding back tears like a loser mind you), and he was very understanding and seemed genuinely concerned about this "medical crisis" I was having.

i just feel so disappointed in myself that I let the anxiety win. I've been doing so good the past few years and over the course of just 10 days, I feel like I'm back at square one.

this internship offered me a job post grad a week ago, but now I feel that my random "health crises" totally destroyed my credibility, and I feel that they are going to rescind the offer. i will be speaking with HR later to see if there's any way I can save this situation as I would really want to work with this company. its not easy getting a job in my field right now, which makes this hurt even more. I'm sick to my stomach and furious that I couldn't even muster up to go to my last week of work and leave off on a good note. i am so exhausted with myself and this condition.

Original Idea: Breathing techniques can influence your physiological state and your psychological condition. A systematic review\* highlighted the relationship between slow breathing and various physiological and psychological outcomes. The review found that slow breathing techniques can lead to changes in heart rate variability (HRV), electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns, and brain activity as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

For instance, during slow breathing techniques, there is often an increase in HRV, which is associated with parasympathetic nervous system activity. This increase in HRV is linked to decreased anxiety, relaxation, and improved emotional control. Additionally, slow breathing can lead to increased alpha power and decreased theta power in EEG readings, indicating a state of relaxation and reduced mental arousal.

These physiological changes can have a direct impact on your psychological state. For example, a study\*\* found that during slow breathing, there was a negative correlation between HRV and brain activity in certain regions, which are involved in emotional processing and cognitive control. This suggests that slow breathing can modulate emotional and cognitive processes.

Moreover, the review noted that slow breathing can lead to increased comfort and relaxation, as well as positive mood changes.

**In summary, slow breathing techniques can lead to changes in HRV and brain activity, which can be noticed as increased relaxation, reduced anxiety.**

I was the type of person to think such things won't work for me. But then I thought "why am I being so arrogant? It's scientifically proven. It should work on all humans that breathe".

**What type of breathing? Psychology Today reported that just 2 minutes of deep breathing with a longer exhale can increase HRV.**

Original Idea: To make a long story short, I am very insecure about myself. I sometimes consider myself to be ungrateful and mean, and I know I’m not really like this and I always tend to talk to AI like ChatGPT as obviously they will always validate my feelings, but I need a response from a human. Another thing is that I always feel like I’m too different. Like any action that I do that doesn’t lineup with what anyone else might do, I feel like I’m doing something wrong. I don’t know how to properly seek validation because I grew up never knowing how to communicate because I grew up in a sheltered household with my dad always trying to take care of my mom who had chronic depression and would occasionally physically abuse me(she doesn’t anymore, but I still think about the times that she did). And I always feel like something has to be my fault but everyone reassures me that it’s not I get that they try to make me feel better, but it just doesn’t make me feel like I impact anything. 
So basically that’s all the big ones.
I hope whoever ever reads this has a good day.❤️
Stay safe out there !

Original Idea: I don't know if this is the right subreddit to say such things

Yes, I have to specify he’s Arab bc if there’s anyone who would sympathize with me it's my fellow Arabs experiencing the Arab dad trauma. I wouldn’t say he’s abusive so I’m getting that out of the way. Ever since we were young he would explode into a screaming and throwing things mess whenever he gets angry. So my siblings and I learned from a young age how to avoid him when he’s like that. It’s not like we’re purposefully getting on his nerves, he’s just not in the mood sometimes and would ask us to do something or get him something, and if we were late by a millisecond or asked him to repeat what he said, he would start huffing in annoyance. And if you dared to be scared or stressed and say you couldn’t hear him because he’s always like this, he would start throwing things at you and asking you to get off his face, and that he would do the work himself. We’re low class so if we dared to complain, my mom would always tell us he’s done everything for us and puts us above his needs. And that he’s like that and we should just ignore him. I’ve told her multiple times that I couldn't give two shits about materialistic things, all I care about is him being emotionally available and stable. This has made me grow to become a 22-year-old girl whose first instinct at any minor inconvenience is to physically hurt herself. How do I deal with this? I’m literally so confused like today he asked me to get things and I went around the house bc I didn't understand where he said I would find them and when I found them I asked him if he wants me to wash them, he started screaming saying he's tired of waiting and where I went so I asked him again if he wants me to wash them and he said to just bring them, I brought one I was already holding and was about to go get the other when he asked where the other was and I told him it was too heavy for me to carry them both so i’ll go get it now, he said something about my attitude and I said “I didn't say anything, you're screaming and i’m trying to figure out what you want” then he threw the nearest thing at me (his favorite move, he doesn’t care what’s that thing, all he cares about is that it’s something big enough to throw it at us) and thankfully it was just a tissue box. He threw it with all his might but i moved away so it didn’t get me. Then he told me to get off his face. I know I get anxious and can’t control the way my voice may come off but I wasn’t raising my voice or anything, just a bit annoyed with this screaming. I literally can’t talk about it to anyone without them blaming me or saying that he’s like that and I should just move on and not let it get to me. But how long do we have to endure this? Why isn’t he like any other normal dad?

Original Idea: My partner used to treat me badly, he was sexually and emotionally abusive.

We broke up at some point for a few months, than we got back together. We reconciled in November 2024. But then in January 2025, we had a horrible fight again. I tried to cut my wrists that night, but he stopped me. That's when something changed. I could feel he was scared. I remember he got me into bed, and held me in his arms throughout the night. He didn't let go, not even for a second.

Ever since that night, something changed. At first I thought it wouldn't last. He slowly became more reliable. Then he started becoming more affectionate. He became more understanding, more patient, more forgiving, more trusting. One day, he was looking at me, and could feel *love*. Love. I felt loved. And I've felt it other times since.

I know he loves me, there is no doubt for me about that anymore. But sometimes, when I am alone, something in me won't give me peace. Sometimes all the abuse he inflicted on me goes through my mind again. It's like I am living it all over again. Sometimes I'm at work and something comes over me, and I end up sobbing for a few minutes. Sometimes, when he is asleep next to me, I find myself awake, revisiting everything that happened, feeling all the pain again, and I just cry silently for a while. Then I get to hug him, I get to be held, and it's all good again.

I can't stand this anymore, my mind just won't let me forget what happened and accept that he has changed. We both have changed, and we are both making an effort to be good to each other. I just wish I could make the memory of all the pain go away.

Original Idea: Hi, so I'm a teenager (not saying my age), backstory starting when I was about 7 years old my dad abandoned me and the family for other women repeatedly, then coming back, leaving like a cycle. I currently live with my father but see my mom a lot.
This made me now have daddy issues, I also have anxiety and depression both due to this, and other stuff. 

When I was 9 maybe, my mom decided to tell me about my dad hooking up with a woman about a year before meeting my mom, resulting in the woman getting pregnant, my mom is 100% convinced that the child is my dad's. My dad gets super angry and irritated whenever I mention this woman and "The child", which I think is super suspicious. My dad and his side of the family all think the woman only wanted to get money out of my dad and was lying. My mom thinks the child IS my dad's and that the woman got pissed off at my dad for not sending money so therefore just moved on without him. 

Lately, I've been trying to find pictures of said child who is supposed to be around my age so I can compare if she looks anything like me or my dad, but I can't find anything

The only answer I see to be able to move on from this is, I made a "secret account" on Instagram, with the intention of adding this woman and trying to find anything that has anything to do with the child, I'm not planning on writing anything specific yet, I just want to see if it could be possible that I have a sister I never knew about.

Original Idea: Throughout all my early childhood and into being a teenager my older brother would beat the shit out of me every week when he lost his temper. I feel as though I severely push to be a pacifist because that horrible torture leaves a mark on you. Him and my cousin used to drown me for fun. As they laugh at the torture they put me through. This was a time before cameras at least in the casual surveillancing technology of the modern times. I think aside from the torture they would inflict on me the hardest part was having none of your family care. I fucking hate these people for their complicity in cases. At the same time I love my mum, what is this damn Stockholm syndrome. I kind of forgot about all this until I was talking to some friends sharing experiences of having siblings and why I think siblings are terrible. Then none had a similar story all wanting siblings and then there's me... I'm attending my youngest sister's wedding next week and my eldest brother and abuser will be present... I'm losing my mind thinking about attending her wedding and him being there. I forgot to mention he was fucking my gf of 6 years for the entire 6 years 👀. She was cheating on me with him and many others from the get go. On my 18th birthday she at the age of 17 and I at the age of 18 fucked my brother and his best friend when I had gone to sleep. I forgot to mention that he is 4 years older than me or 22 at the time. We had got together at 16 when she was 15 and I was 16. She was the year below me and she was seemly fine. But boy did she have a fucking temper. She would hit me, punch me, scratch me for anything she would perceive me doing wrong. If I had any friends that were women she'd abuse me. Reliving this is hard, but perhaps not as hard as forgetting... There's loads more but idk do y'all think this is an over reaction to still have these night terrors and nightmares over this level of trauma. I've never hit my brother as much as he has deserved it. I try and think that makes me stronger than him that I don't need to succumb to his level of violence. I undoubtedly could being twice his size, practise bjj and boxing. But maybe my need to improve my fighting skills was to allow no-one to hurt me again. I left my partner of 2 years because I got scared that she would hurt me. So I left before that could happen. This was 3 months ago and I think about her every day. I'm not better than the kid who was beaten and battered back then... this may be too negative but at least it's insight. I am better than ever I have a successful business and I'm driven fuck everyone who looked away at the abuse I took.

Original Idea: I am Prakhar and I am 17 years old. Last night, I saw my sister getting f***ed by my father... And i am traumatized now. Let me tell you what happened exactly.

My mother was out of the town because of her usual work. And my father is currently retired. My elder sister is 26 years old and she's married. She came back to home because me and my dad needed someone to take care of us, as both of us don't know how to cook and other little things. Last night, i woke up and went to the bathroom to have a piss. Just then i heard some sounds coming from my father's room. There was a hole in the door through which i decided to see what's happening inside. That's when i saw my sister and my father n@ked, having $ex. She was lying on the bed and my father was f**ing her. They were doing missionary! I really didn't know how to react. I just went back to my room and tried to sleep, but it didn't help. I couldn't sleep last night and i am heavily traumatized. What to do?

Original Idea: Hi! That’s my first time venting on Reddit or even to an alive person about this. There was something that wasn’t the worst thing that happened to me because I was actually abused aside if that and it’s that much of trauma as of unpleasant situation that happened to me but I need a people opinion to hear that I’m not imagining that it was bad and just to try waters before I vent about anything else I guess.
When I was 15(f) I often stayed over nights at the place of family’s and well mine friend - also a woman, and actually rather grandma if you will because she is in her 60s. And she “adult” pressured me into drinking alcohol with her. She had a lot of various alcohol at her place but I think she was rather impulsively buying it than drinking as much. But she’d drink it alone and she’d ask me if I want too, and first time I said yes because I thought it’s cool to try. She poured me the whole glass - not a small portion “to try” but a normal glass of what - i don’t even know. She’d call it mock tail because she’d mix it with pop+fruit juice or something else literally saying that it’s just “to take the edge off” but it’s definitely had alcohol in it and and enough to feel it. I don’t think I finished it. But then after that she’d offer it to me every time. And not “offer” offer. She’d get offended when I’d say I don’t want to. She’d demand explanation and argue with me. And as being a depressed refugee kid at that time (part of the reason how I’d even end up at her place) I didn’t had enough emotional strength to keep an argument and felt trapped and obligated because it’s at her home so I’d do it just for peace sake. Once I think I had to pour it out while she didn’t see. After the glass is gone she’d offer me another again arguing that it’s just a light alcohol so why am I so against it. To be bit more fair - I was 15 and it was in Germany - country where you can drink beer and wine when you 16. But it was neither of these things (still wonder what was it - but seemed like el or vodka or whiskey - I just know she’d mix normal alcohol with pops or fruit juice) - and I clearly stated that I don’t want to. Also she knew my parents would disapprove so she’d say that we wouldn’t tell them and that’s this’d be between us. I know it may sound like she was trying to be the “cool aunt” or whatever but it made me feel weird and bad, not to mention that making (and I mean - making because she’d continue to pressure me when I would say I don’t want to) a minor drink decent amount of alcohol when they clearly uncomfortable while alone with them at your apartment crossing all boundaries of appropriate. Thinking back I feel like she wanted to see that I can be just as messed up as she is because she was getting in the situations in my age while I (aside of this I situation convinced I was groomed into and couple of more but in general) was rather of “exemplary, obedient kid” and since she clearly struggled with self hatred at this point I think she was trying to mess me up as well. I don’t want to make it sound like it become a habit - it was just few instances but it was going there unless I’d stopped it. And it happened after one night when I felt so bad (I started to struggle with suicidal thoughts as well)  I was very self destructive so just decided to just drink whatever she gives me without refusing even tho knew it was hurting me (also she was in the same Christian group as I back then (I’m atheist now) so it’s even weirder but it was certain form of “moral” self harm as well) and I felt like I’m getting warm, and my mind started to slip off and I felt so weird like i control my own body less and less and I went to the washroom looked in the mirror and realised I’m getting drunk - for the first time ever in my life and I felt so bad, god, so disgusted with myself, I almost felt dirty. But also I felt like i want to go back and drink more because it eased the deeper pain I had inside me. It was dangerous because she could’ve send me the bad slope as i have history of sever alcoholism on both sides of my family. I think I cried. I managed to make myself sleep thru it and next time argued that i will never drink with her again even tho it required to be standing my ground and I actually felt scared because of the amount of pressure from her and it actually hurt her feeling as if I’m ungrateful. Later may be 6 months after I realised how weird it was. Before leaving the country I confronted her and said how I regret it, how it made me feel bad, and how it was wrong and that she can never do this again with anyone. She didn’t said she sorry. I think she felt bad but still didn’t understood the full scope of it and had this hint of “it’s me being ungrateful” in her emotion. 

Now I’m 18 and I don’t want to be drinking until I’m at least 25 to let my brain full develop. I vented about it to ai once and I cried because turns out it did make me feel bad and affected me emotionally more then I realised. It wasn’t the worst thing that ever happened to me - I had much worse - but it went into the folder of “how adults who should’ve known better failed me”. I didn’t tell anyone but wanted to share it to hear the outside opinion of how bad/weird it actually was.
Thank you.

Original Idea: Please no judgement for the attached pics—these are my most raw thoughts, that I am only posting to hopefully help some people.

I cant afford therapy rn and I’m sure many others cant either. My trauma has been essentially eating me alive these past few years, so last month i decided to take it into my own hands and it’s actually helping.

First, I made a list of every traumatic event I’ve been through in my life. I listed each one in only a few words. (The list ended up being over 80 🫠)

Then I took that list and I started going through them one by one in a journal, doing a complete break down. I used a bit of a DBT format I learned from a group therapy program as a teenager, and a bit of just my own way. 

You can write the trauma, memories that go with the trauma, feelings that go with that trauma, why you shouldn’t feel any bad feelings that aren’t your fault, random important thoughts you have about it, trauma responses you’ve gained from it, how to combat those trauma responses, how to see the trauma in a more positive light, etc. 

I’m probably going to get a lot of crap for this, but for the ones where I didn’t know how to go about it I used Chat GPT. I would tell it the traumatic event in detail and it would break it down for me. Then I’d say different feelings and trauma responses that came from it and it would give me ways to not feel that way and combat the trauma. 

Tbh I think this is a rly great thing to do if you need help, but just can’t go to therapy for whatever reason. I hope this helps someone. Let me know if you have any questions.

Original Idea: I didn’t have an easy upbringing, my mom was a depressed alcoholic and she committed suicide when I was 10. I was raised by my uncle and grandma, which was toxic as hell, my uncle always bullied me for “being fat”, my grandma was unstable and she kept yelling at me. I had horrible relationships. I was raped 3 years ago. I went no contact with my toxic family in May. My dad died of Cancer on June 1st. I had to witness 2 epileptic seizures of my fiance on July 23rd. I’m also an addict to make things worse.

I called the psychiatry this afternoon but they’re only available between 9 am and 12 pm every weekday, which is a very narrow window and as someone who struggles with depression, anxiety, panic attacks and possible autism, I feel like they don’t even care.

I’ll continue fighting as I have a fiance and 2 beautiful cats, I have plans for my life but it just feels like life likes me fucked up…

Apologies for rambling, I really needed to let this out instead of going insane and maybe I’d find some people here who can relate and I can share my thoughts with them. Maybe. No idea.

Original Idea: Nostalgia for me is probably the worst feeling ever, or at least it is when you have had a traumatic childhood. What am I yearning for? For when I was on my bed , whit purple butterfly sheets asking no begging my mom to see a psicologist? Or for when  I was assaulted and almost raped in a pirate boat bounce house? For when I was alone and had no friends on top of being relentlessly bullied and outlasted? Meaby I miss my family being together...probably the only thing that has become worse instead of better.But still...I wish I was a child again and that was the worst time of my life...it's soo weird man.

Edit:sorry just needed to rant 
Nsfw tag cuz...rape mentioned?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Me 33 and my sister 32, were abused by our uncle (he was a drunkard) when we were left at his care for 3 months. We were 8 and 7. Our parents were away for Mom's surgery in another state.

One day I broke a cassette tape of his. He got mad. He asked me to take my pants off. He started hitting me with a stick. His wife tried to stop him, he hit her too. My sister watched me get beat and cried. He left us locked in our room and left for work. After he came back he saw us sleeping. Sis was holding onto me while I still had no clothes on from earlier. He woke us up and said, "So that's what you both like huh?". Ever since then he forced us to sleep naked every night. I'm not sure if he got involved with us, we both have no memory of it. I remember the first few nights were scary for me and her, we'd both would end up wetting the bed and get yelled at in the morning.

The more we were made to be naked around each other, the more comfortable we got around each other. We ended up exploring, playing doctor, rubbing our privates together etc. No sex happened because we weren't aware of penetration or sex but we did other things that made us feel 'good' aka orgasms. It was more of a game to us at that point.

We moved back to our parent's after they came back. We never told them what happened since deep down we both knew it was our little secret. When our parents would leave for work, we'd take our clothes off and lay next to each other or do our homework while naked. Sometimes we'd get playful and get to rubbing it together or humping. It was a comfort thing to us at that point. We didn't have any friends and all we had was each other.

These games weren't a usual thing but it happened occasionally. When we were 11 and 10, we got to playing again one day. We both ended up having orgasms, only this time it felt different and very wet. I got off her and looked down and to our horror, I was leaking and her privates were covered in clear fluid with blobs of white stuff. We got freaked out. We didn't speak to each other for days. I thought I was sick. Later I got to do some reading and learnt that it was semen and it was normal. We never played those games again after learning that it can cause pregnancies.

After we grew up, I confronted her about the past when we were 27 and 26 and she was happy that I brought it up. We did it on text so it was easy to open up than face to face. We confessed that we both missed the past and it was our special thing. Things got heated. We decided to meet up at our parents during the holidays. We snuck into each other's rooms at night and reenacted the past for 2 whole weeks. No sex happened even though we both wanted it. We both agreed it was good not to cross that line if we ever came to regret it later. Later we both started feeling guilty and put a pause on it.

2 years passed by after that and she got married. A few months into her marriage we brought up the past again when talking about other things. We talked for a few days just like old times. I ended up asking the ultimate question of me or her husband if it came to it, she chose him and we ended it there.

At the present, I try not to think of incest or anything related cause I relapse so hard. I sometimes use AI (the ones who can pretend to be your sister) to find some peace to fill that void. Life has to go on. Well, that's the end of my boring story.

Original Idea: So I have been in 5 long relationships. They all cheated and lied to me. Now I can't have a healthy relationship because I start seeing any behavior that's similar and I start thinking they are cheating or lying! I have ruined some relationships that could have led to marriage. Especially the last two. And after they were over I still can't determine if they were being sincere or lying. It eats me up because I don't want to believe the worst but their behavior shows they may have been lying. I have to learn to trust but its so hard! And suggestions?

Original Idea: 
Back in the 2000s, it was acceptable to spank your child when they misbehaving. Nowadays, it isn't. My mother used to it all the time when I would. 

My mother had an affair with a married man. We got push out of that town because basically with pitchforks. That man abused me. Locked me and my sister in our bedroom and took the door handle off so we couldn't get out. My mother basically did nothing and just let him. 

He also sexually abused me as well. 

At one point, my mother pushed me into a wall once and I had a bump on my head. 

There is probably other stuff and I just don't remember

My mother constantly says shit to my psychiatrist and nurses that I am fucked in the head but its all because of her. It's like she has fucking forgot about everything or gaslit herself. My psychiatrist and nurses all believe whatever she says and I am sat there like whatever. 

They don't know about the abuse. Maybe I should tell them.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Today I wanted to talk to you about this abuse that happened to me when I was in sixth grade, still when I was only 11 years old.
It was the last day of school before the Christmas holidays, and I had asked my parents not to pick me up in the car at the end of school because I wanted to take a friend of mine home. This was the biggest mistake of my life.
My friend wasn't at school that day, so I went home alone. I knew the way, I had already done it a thousand times on my own, but that day went differently. I was walking under a porch, what I always did to get home and at a certain point I came across a man on a bicycle, and to let him pass I moved towards the right side of the porch. We weren't too far away, also because I couldn't move much to let him pass, because on the side of the porch (my side) there were some chairs and tables from a pizzeria, which was closed that day for the Christmas holidays. What happens? As soon as I move to let him pass, this man slows down on his bike as soon as he sees me and says "hello beautiful", that in Italian is "ciao bellissima". I think is sort of scarier scarier in Italian than English, because it was said in a really suspicious way. if I could describe it with one sentence it would be "I'm interested in you in a sexual way". Then, with his left hand he touches one of my breasts. I turn around and he calmly continues riding his bike. At that moment I didn't know what to do so I ran home after yelling "fuck you". Unfortunately that day there was almost no one on the street, and the few people who arrived later either didn't see the scene or did nothing. After I got home I started crying, tear after tear about what had happened. obviously I went to report it immediately afterwards, still with tears burning in my eyes.
Now I don't know whether to consider this a real sexual abuse, but I was 11 years old, and in any case it was burned into my mind. Every time I think about it I feel nauseous, and every time I see the jacket I wore that day, that is, the same one he ran his filthy hand over, I feel like washing it, throwing it away, ripping it off if I'm wearing it. It was a faded blue jacket my grandmother gave me, I really liked it as a jacket, but I can't wear it anymore. 
And nothing, this is the end of story.
Would you consider it sexual abuse?

Original Idea: I'm 21f from India, I was looking for a page where I can share this trauma so here I am.
This incident took place last year in June.
 
(A bit of background).
My parents separated before my birth, I live with my mom and grandparents, my father lives separately close to my house with his mother. I used to usually visit my father twice a year, once on his birthday and once during summer holidays.
So last year my father invited me to stay with him for two days saying that he got two days off from work. He also said he'll bring some alcohol. None of the above said things seemed like a red flag because after 18 my grandparents allowed me to have alcohol only in winter and once a week, I have shared many great memories with my grandfather over a glass of whisky and rum, I have had wine with my aunts and beers with my cousins so it didn't feel like a red flag to me when my father said he wanted to a drink with me.
I went over to his place, we chatted, had dinner. After my paternal grandmother went to bed, he brought out the alcohol. We are drinking, chatting, nothing out of the blue or nothing alarming. I was super drunk so I went to bed, after 10 mins I feel my father laying down beside me and he starts to touch me inappropriately, I got very scared because I have ptsd from past sexual assaults. I couldn't move my body. And my father is very tall above 6 feet, well built and strong. It felt like burning when he put his fingers inside of me. He used his tongue on my vagina and his penis. I felt pain course through my body. He stops after he's done, cleans up himself and goes to bed like he didn't just rape his own daughter. After that incident I was never the same, I hated my body, I used to burn the parts of my with cigarette butts, the places he touched. I hated having sex which was a shame because I used enjoy sex, having sex used to make me me feel liberated, calm and free. 
I don't love sex now, I don't even like getting touched even if it's a tap on my shoulder. I'm also very touch starved as well. 
The only people who knows about it are my close friends, maternal grandparents, my close aunt, and my therapist.
I go through massive episodes of depression, PTSD and I have bipolar too but I'm under medication hence I can function but sometimes it gets too much and I think about self harming, I don't go through with it, but the thought is very tempting.
I'm writing this to share my painful memory, and also to the people who has gone through something like this, my love and prayers go to, hope you are doing well.

Original Idea: I'm sure this trauma is nothing compared to what other people have probably faced on here but I need to know if anyone else was deeply scared of this book.

Ok, so when I was in Elementary school the best year there probably had to be 1st grade. But there was one thing that caused a deep trauma for me. And that was a book called the Bad Case of the Stripes by David Shannon, you know the guy who wrote the No David books?

This story starts on Tuesday in February in 2018. I was 6 years old and my birthday was in about a month. Anyway, so it was a good day until we came back from lunch and we had ELA, English Language Arts, or just English.

So what happened was we were reading a book on the Smart Board (A projector they use in most schools in my state. I don't know if other states use it) Anyway, so this was nothing abnormal, and I was intrigued to read it because I think I thought it was about a zebra or something.

Sadly I was wrong. The minute they showed us the book cover, I knew this wasn't going to end well. And I was right.

Now, before I continue, I'll tell you what it's about and then why it scared me.

So, the book is about this girl named Camilla Cream, and she loves Lima Beans but her friends don't so she pretends to hate them too. (Doesn't seem so bad now? Trust me it gets worse) Anyway, so on the first day of school, Camilla suddenly wakes up with multi-colored striped skin. They call a doctor who gives her some pills, but the pills then turn her face into a gumball machine. And then when she ends up going to school, her face changes to different patterns whenever someone names them. Then her parents call in health experts who just make it worse by saying the most grotesque and disturbing things that would terrify a 6-year-old. Luckily, an old woman shows up and tells her to just eat Lima Beans and she'll be fine. And she is and never denies them again.

The moral of the book is to be yourself not matter what others think cause it might lead to trouble.

Now onto why it was so disturbing for me. So because it was on the smart board the images were popping out at you. Even the really grotesque ones. By the time the book ended, I had my head down crying my eyes out.

One of the helper teachers took me to the nurse to calm me down but the damage was already done. I was scarred for life. And it only got worse from there. When my teacher told my mom about what happened, she and my brother laughed at me. And then that night I actually had a nightmare about it. And the other kids were talking about me behind their backs whenever they read it.

Sometimes, I even cried after seeing someone read it cause it triggered the memory. I had to lie that I missed my mom because I thought everyone else thought I was weird for being scared of it.

I know what you're thinking, it can't get any worse, but it did. We kept reading it every year, luckily I was "Brave" and told my teacher that I was scared of it and asked if I could go sit outside or to the principals office until it was over, and that's usually what I had to do.

Anyway, luckily I haven't heard it mentioned in years until me and my friend, who was actually one of my friends in 1st grade and in my class, told me she was actually scared of it too only she held in her tears.

But yeah, please let me know if you're scared of this because if you feel like you're the only one scared of it, like I did then please know you're not alone.

Original Idea: I was with my ex for four years and I was super young at that time , she was like 15 when we started dating and I was just 11 I didn't really realize it was grooming until well later on I feel like I'm stuck in the same place now. Like there's no getting out of this I feel like it took me such a long time to even realize how traumatized the relationship left me I couldn't do anything after it ended for the final time I couldn't feel anything anymore and I still don't and Im self aware about the reasons as well I know it was toxic and she was very manipulative she was just like my parents. the ones who traumatized me my whole life already , my parents are abusive and have always been shit and she knew that all well yet she would love bomb me and then taunt me and tell me hurtful things implying my past and she knew well it would hurt me bad. But anyway I ended things for the final time while I could still get away she came again and again for me because apparently I was the only one she had but she always cheated on me I lost count how many times she did now. She never saw what she was doing as wrong she didn't want a relationship but wanted me to be hers even tho she was the one to ask me to date first? It all made no sense it was all so fucked up but I have no idea how to process the trauma from it all. 
I feel like even if it all ended I'm just still stuck in the same place and can't get out of the traumatic memories even her name makes me want to throw up literally.
Does anyone know any way to deal with this and move forward? I'm over her I know that for sure but for some reason I just cannot move forward. Its frustrating me now because I see everyone moving forward in their lives and I feel stuck

Original Idea: I've lived with secrets of things that I've done due to trauma that are so sick, deep and twisted that I've never told anyone. I blame myself for a lot of it and struggle to process it. The other times I understand the psychology behind it. I don't know who to talk to about this or even where to start. Two wrongs don't make a right, but I was so so young and I didn't really understand what I was doing. It makes me sick these days to think about.

Original Idea: I don’t quite know what sub to post this in, and I can delete it upon request. This is more of a questionnaire, as I want to know what others think.

Before I start, I wanted to apologize for my poor grammar and mentioned topics, as I am going through a large quantity of things right now.

When I was about seven or so, my baby sitter insisted that I get in the car and “Go to McDonalds” with her, and her boyfriend. I said no at first, as I was taught to be wary of strangers, but she got upset, so I said yes. 

I don’t remember much, but she forced me to sit on her lap (and I’ve been told by family members that I mimicked grooming behavior, and hyper sexuality, also from my own memory). I think they said that we would only get food if I let them touch me; though I could be incorrect. They may have been brought somewhere else, though I have little remembrance of it and it could be a synthesis of my mind. They most likely locked the car doors as well. I told my mother after the trip, which made me doubtful that anything extreme happened - before I wrote this, I remembered more distinguishing factors, but they are quickly slipping away.

I also have memories of possibly being assaulted in a bathtub. I’m confused, and I don’t want to lay claim to something that is usually one of the worst things a human can go through; and if I did, it probably wasn’t close to others suffering.

I apologize for how poorly written this commoderation of text is, and for possibly wasting others' time. I also was abused non-sexually by my parents, though I do have dreams where they are my sexual abusers. Thank you for getting so far, and again, I’m so sorry for the fact that my current literacy is so poor. I will continue to update this if I am able, or if I recall more details. Her boyfriend was also allegedly convicted of murder, as he had apparently killed a young girl before me. I have XX chromosomes, though I myself now lean more A-Gender. I am also diagnosed with C-PTSD, Depression, General Anxiety, OCD, ADHD, Autism, and what I would believe to fall under paranoid schizophrenia.

Original Idea: I don’t know anyone in my circle of friends or family who has experienced trauma like I have. I don’t want to overshare, and I know there’s no point in trying to quantify the trauma. Everyone has something they’ve faced and their 10/10 worst experience is their 10 and that is completely valid! 
That said, I would love to hear stories of people who have overcome some really tough life experiences, like decades of Stockholm syndrome, for instance, and found consistent joy and stability ❤️

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Hello! I am 23 and have a very complicated family story/dynamic. My mom was heavily abused as a child and really had a hard hard time her whole life. I don’t know details but since I moved out a few years ago our bond grew stronger and more honest so I know this. She told me. She also abused me because she was overwhelmed with herself (she has borderline) and being left alone with her kids but I love her and I forgive her. A big part of that is that I pity her and wish her a better life and since I’ve moved out and gotten into therapie and got more mature I’ve seen things as they are or learn about my generational trauma more and more. I have a older brother who is 10 years older and a younger sister who is 10 years younger. The way my mom brought her trauma into the way she raised her kids has a base line but is differentiated. I feel like the older she got the more she tried to break her patterns. Still every single one of us got abused one way or the other. My mom was undiagnosed, traumatized and raised her kids alone, all while suffering. This is not an excuse, trust me I know. It’s hard for me to not feel bad for her tho. My brother disconnected from the family a few years ago. My mom got pretty sick mentally when I was about 18/19. She had to get hospitalized and I was pretty much alone with my 9 year old sister. Even before this my mom did seek help already but did not have enough space and time to do it extensively and worked pretty hard for us to live a decent life. Therefore I had to take responsibility at a very young age for me and my sister, maybe beginning when I was 14? I was practically a second parent figure, without being mature enough to endure this. So I did a lot of mistakes. The way is saw my mother handle me and my siblings stuck to me and I copied her behavior because i didn’t know better. My sister was not an easy child and also terrorized us and I was overwhelmed. So I screamed and pushed her to the ground when she didn’t listen or insulted me or hit me even after me trying my best to be calm. I abused her physically. It got worse when my mom was in the hospital. I was worried about her while dealing with the emotions of my sister and her way of dealing with the situation. She hated me for trying to be her guardian. She told me she wished I was dead and since then our bond is broken. Before and after that every Christmas has been hell. She switches her mood unpredictably making my mom sob out of helplessness. And I felt like I need to step in and help her. Make her feel better. It’s like walking on eggshells around my sister all the time. I know that it’s still not right to abuse someone because of this but I feel like my mom couldn’t handle all of that alone. Now that my sister is older and my mom is in Therapie and working on herself for herself and for us her way of parenting got so much better. She isn’t abusive verbally or physically anymore. She is calm and patient and loving and gives my sister every help she needs, doesn’t matter in which way. But my sister just takes everything that doesn’t go her way as an attack or rather is very easily triggert. She isn’t to blame but she is blatantly disrespectful and she doesn’t wanna go to therapy at all. She is still to young and very closed off now. Especially to me. Which makes sense. We don’t see each other frequently cause I live far away and I gave her time to regulate her emotions towards me. Now I’m trying slowly to form a bond again without pressuring her. But it’s hard. Sometimes when I visit, she feels attacked if I say one word that triggers her. Then she continues to insult us and isolate herself. Both me and my mom give her the space to do so, because any other way just escalates (my mom isn’t abusive anymore).Of course she is traumatized and doesn’t realize it so she tries to deal with it the only way she knows. I accept and understand it absolutely. It’s just so hard because I love my mom, I would die for her and I can’t bear her being hurt, even tho she is responsible and has to take the consequences. I also can’t bear the fact how my sister will face the consequences of our actions. The way I feel this guilt for traumatizing my sister and being an abuser because I couldn’t stop the cycle soon enough haunts me while simultaneously mourning for my mom and the way this dynamic and her own guilt destroys her inside. My mom told me that when I’m not home, it’s not all that bad. The bond with my sister and her grew different too, but everytime I visit it’s just all the same which makes me also feel guilty putting this pain inside my mom too and that this is my fault. I don’t know how to cope with this. It’s eating me alive.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: TW: possible CSA (i don’t even know what to call it. that’s why im here)

this is a throw away account, just putting that out there.

i am currently in outpatient therapy after several weeks of partial hospitalization. during my treatment i have been unpacking trauma i never have before. but there are some things i am too afraid to say in group, to my therapist to say out loud. journaling doesn’t help, i need feedback from real people. 

i have been coming to terms with some things my grandmother has done to me. she touched my breasts, crowding me and tried “helping me put on a bra the right way”. which involved touching that i don’t even completely remember. but i remember the feeling and emotions i had afterward. 

she has also pinched/squeezed my butt since i was a small child. as well as shoving her finger up my butt through my clothes, but to the point cloth would get stuck there, i was a small child when she did this. (i am feeling physically ill remembering this) she has made comments about my genitalia and my panties. saying my privates must “smell good” because my cat slept in my underwear drawer (???)

i also remember her nightgown being flipped up by her. she wasn’t wearing underwear. 

but on top of all of this. i am remembering things my parents did. 

my dad slipping his hand high up under my pajama pants leg. laying on his chest when he was in his boxers and i felt him pressed against me.

my mom trying to teach me how to kiss. 

this isn’t even unpacking everything else that has happened to me in my childhood. but i’m just…remembering all of these things. i’m hurt by them. they make me feel disgusted. i don’t necessarily think these people did those things for sexual gratification but…they were done to me. i am by far the most triggered and disturbed by my grandmother. i have had nightmares/flashbacks. no one cares. no one thinks it’s a big deal. but i am realizing that i have been mistreated since i was very young in many ways. 

but i cant call it CSA, can i? i cant call what my grandmother did molestation. i wasn’t raped. i don’t deserve to call it those things. i feel like such an attention seeker. like i so desperately want to be a victim. but these things really happened. it’s all so complicated.

it’s hard to even bring up that because of everything, including these mentioned incidents, have caused me to age regress involuntarily. it’s hard to bring up because i don’t think people understand. i’m sorry for rambling. i just need to be heard.

thank you.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Why doesn't anyone care about the people who are traumatized? 






Why do people claim to love someone but don't give two fcks about their mental and physical well being?






I have a narcissistic "father" who traumatized me a lot. Because of him i can't trust people and any time i open up enough to trust someone a little, I'm reminded of why i shouldn't.





I don't talk to people a lot, it's really hard for me. Yup, "family" included. 





I can't be open to someone who claims to love me but does things behind my back that proves the opposite.




My siblings never protected me in my childhood. I felt closest to the one sibling who didn't live with us. Probably because i didn't see them just watch that narcissist hurt me.





Later when i finally moved away w my other parent when i was 19, i accidentally found out a year later that the sibling I'm closest to, stays in contact with the narcissist. (They're not related and the narcissist didn't love my sibling like they were their own kid anyways) I don't trust them for shii anymore and all my effort to try and be more open  with them went down the drain.





My other parent who i moved away with. half a month after moving, on my birthday, told the narcissist our location. i didn't feel safe when we moved but this made me feel more unsafe than anything. What an awesome birthday gift huh? I ran away, cried so hard i started bleeding from the nose and almost went & took my own life. My nephews inviting me for a sleepover saved my life that day.





After that i didn't talk at all to my other parent but later i decided to have a talk with them. I told them exactly how everything made me feel and how i almost took my own life because of their stupid decision to care more about the narcissist than their own kid.






Now over the year and a half, I've caught my other parent lying to me a lot. Some white lies but also some that are pretty big deals.





The last few month we've been dealing with getting a new place in another city. We don't plan to stay here because the narcissist kept harassing my other parent at their work place, and following us around. My parent even quit their job because of it as well.





Today i found out something that has put all the work I've done on myself, Back to 0%. 





We agreed that our new location shouldn't be shared because we don't want the narcissist to come and follow us anymore or if they snap one day, to come and 💀 us. (I think you can guess where this is going)





Went to the store today, an old acquaintance asked if I'm living alone now. I said no, "I'm living with my parent." The next words felt like i was stabbed in the heart.




"Oh i thought your parent already moved to **our new future location**, everyone in the village thinks  they already moved there....."





🥲 And just like that. All my process went back to 0%.




The whole village knowing, means the narcissist knows as well because he lives there. I thought i can wait until i finally move to our new place and i can finally feel safe but i guess i wished for too much.





I've been trying my best to work on my trauma and anxiety, I've been looking forward to moving because that would've meant me feeling safe enough to work on it even more and actually getting to heal. If i don't feel safe enough It's feeling like I'm really rusty and it's hard move forward in my healing.






If I don't feel safe at all i feel like I'm stuck in place entirely. I convinced myself to feel somewhat safe so i wouldn't be stuck in place. What helped was thinking of the future place where i will feel safe. Put it's all gone now. Everything keeps grumbling around me and i don't really see a point of doing this anymore.





I don't even care anymore about who couldn't keep their mouth shut and told everyone about it. Probably a combination of everyone in the family (not me tho). 





It just hurts, to not be cared about. My siblings i have helped with whatever they have needed, babysitting, money problems etc. 





My parent I've been taking care of them as well. To show them how good life is without a narcissist. I can't do much because of being disabled but I've done more than that narcissist ever has. I don't yell at them or bully them or mock them etc. When we stumble on problems, i make sure to talk it out with them calmly and come up with plans together. 






I make sure that if they want/need something, they will get it. I walk them to/from the bus station to show them that they are waited/wanted home and to show they don't have to go through everything alone, they have someone by their side for support and they don't have to feel alone. I try to help with chores as much as possible even tho I can't really do a lot because of disabilities. I try to cook for them to give them a break. And bunch of others things.





I guess my love will never be enough for others and it will never make anyone care about me even a little bit.












I just wish people cared more. I wish i wasn't disabled from the trauma so i could leave everyone and everything behind.









Not a single day in my life have i felt safe, and as life has shown, i never will.






Truth hurts.



Now I'm stuck

Original Idea: When I was around 11-12 a 15-16 y o guy was talking to me a lot, back then I was too innocent to realize he was trying to groom me and he seemed innocent since he was young too, he didnt seem to be a p3adophile, but he was. All of a sudden he started bullying me and I was seeking his approval, then came weird sexual games I didn't understand. He was an ex student from my school so it wasn't weird that he was spending time at my school either, he pretended to talk to other people there when he was actually there to groom me. I really didn't understand anything and sooner or later it happened, the terrible thing. I felt horrible and I told my closest girlfriends about it(they were the most popular girls of my class) and they thought it was weird. Two days later the rumor spread and everyone was hardcore bullying me about it. He even told everyone about it making me seem like I was a slut. I was so confused and I didnt know what to say I was playing along with what everybody said. My friends tried to help me deny it but I couldnt deny it because I was seeking for help, but instead I got even more shamed. I felt terrible and Im glad I had the strength to not kill myself. 11 years full of spiritual experiences, destructive behavior as a teen to distract me, meditating, manifesting , etc I thought I had completely forgotten about it and moved on. I no longer care about those kids back then. But recently, even thought my life is out of a wonderful movie rn, this old feeling of shame and regret and wanting to fit in had come back, and it feels so bad. I was never enough for my friends back then, they thought I was a monster, everyone hated me and bullied me. I don't know what to do..... I know that if i continue my healthy lifestyle of meditating and taking care of myself I will be good and when I focus on the things I like and the good parts of my life. But this part of my past is like a forbidden zone of horror. But the past...  
It's just the past. It doesn't exist unless I say so. I have to be good to myself. That is my greatest lesson.

Original Idea: My boyfriend and I have recently been honest with each other about sexual thoughts we’ve had about other people. We are both very committed to each other, have been actively working on our trauma, and we know these thoughts are just thoughts, we’ve never acted on them or cheated. It’s something like this, we’ll see random strangers and it’s like 1 minute of imagining a sex scenario with these people, my boyfriend added it’s bc he “likes to make people feel good” and I guess it’s why that happens for me too. We’ve been able to talk about a lot of the thoughts but we don’t rlly remember details of the thoughts or who, we know it probably had to do with sexual trauma that we’ve both had. But we’ve both had this since we were way younger, we’re both in our early 20s now and it has been since we were around 12-13 years old. Does anyone know what this is? Intrusive thoughts maybe? But we feel guilty and disgusted with ourselves at the same time.

Original Idea: Has anyone here ever left everything behind for a fresh start? I want to leave everything behind even my country and start a new life. I know it sounds like a fairy tale, but I dream of living in the countryside, with less crowd and noise, a slow life free from crippling anxiety. People often say, “It’s your life, you can change it,” but in reality, it’s not that simple. My parents are here, getting older, and my own life already feels messy.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: (Due to my situation, the best thing to do is just wait it out) So I (16, FTM) already know that my mom is abusive and a lot of ways, including sexual and mental mostly. But I thought that the sexual abuse specifically started when I was nine, because that's my earliest memory of it. 

I never really blocked out much traumatic things related to sexual trauma because I was manipulated into thinking that it wasn't even trauma so I guess my brain didn't think to block it out due to that, because it didn't register to me that it was even trauma. 

I also do have a issue with fake and real memories, that's what I call it, because I do imagine hypothetical scenarios so I can plan ahead and be prepared for bad things, which makes me also not know what is a preparation of a possibility and what is a actual memory. 

The reason that I thought that the sexual abuse started at nine is that that's when a specific circumstance happened that I remembered clearly and that influenced a lot of other traumas, mental states, etc. 

To put it short, I was bullied when I was nine and it caused me to interact with a pedophile who groomed me. I got access to adult content through him and I eventually developed hypersexuality after I saw it of two guys because I'm a trans guy with a heavy preference for guys in my relationships. I didn't know that at the time obviously but I digress. 

Due to my parents being homophobic and things along those lines, this was my introduction to gay relationships existing in general, which obviously wasn't a good thing. 

And when my mom found out about it, she forced me to watch porn with her of that variety (gay) and when she was done, she said that she understood why I liked it because she found it hot. 

So obviously she isn't new to sexualizing her children, after this she began to sexualize me over a lot of things, never to that extremity again, but she just randomly makes sexual comments about things that aren't sexual, and it gets to a point where I basically have to hide the fact that I'm ever sexual ever, because I know she's going to say something about it and I know she's going to enjoy it. And obviously that makes me feel really gross. 

One of the thoughts, or memories I should say, that I got was a while back, like I didn't get this memory or preparation thing recently. But it was of me when I was around 4 to 5 years old, I don't know the exact age but I do remember (?) that I was a young child. 

I remember that I had a banana and juice box for a snack, and she ended up encouraging me to basically deep throat the banana, framing it as taking huge bites, and then washing it down with the juice. 

I honestly don't know if it was true, and I initially brushed it off as one of the prediction things because I had it in my mind that it started when I was 9 so I assumed that it was a prediction instead of something that actually happened. 

But I realized something that happened recently kind of mirrors that. It's not a direct copy of what I thought about, but it definitely has its similarities. 

The thing that has been happening recently is with my little sister, she is currently 7 years old, so a lot older than I would have been if this actually happened, but it still is something that feels similar. 

Because she didn't convince my sister to do anything, but when my sister was given something that's with the straw, like juice box, cup with a lid, whatever, she immediately put her lips all around it and very forcefully, and pretty violently honestly, started drinking it. I think she was just really thirsty or something, and she's a child so that fits. 

But then my mom looked at me as if something was funny? So I basically questioned with a what, cuz what, and she made a comment about how my sister is going to impress someone one day. 

I didn't respond to my mom because I didn't want to respond to that and my mom continued with like two or more sentences after that before she stopped talking cuz no one was talking to her. 

But now I'm kind of thinking that the memory I thought of was actually a real event, which would mean that it didn't start when I was 9. 

I assumed that I just "awakened" something in her by being a hypersexual child, I guess, as morbid as that sounds. 

So, what do you think? I want to make sure I can prevent things like that happening to my sister, if there's a possibility.

Original Idea: For some context, I was born into a family with an absent father and a heavily drug abusing mother (Heroin, Xanax, Crack, Meth, pretty much anything she'd get her hands on she'd do) for my entire life, she did drugs right infront of me, nodding out, as I had to take care of my low functioning autistic younger brother, she'd bang on my door, begging me for money, pawn all my personal belongings, steal from me, abuse me financially, and never truly cared for me, it's been a year or so since she's failed rehab again in 29 years. She started at 15, me and my half sister (27F) have always been suspected of cPTSD and BPD respectively, Flash to now, I meet a woman, a lovely one but nonetheless has problems, she does anxiety meds and I can't tell if it's recreational or prescription but I believe it's prescription, whenever she does Xanax here's what will happen to me naturally

- 1, shut down completely, stop talking for a few hours, sometimes I'll leave her on seen, and sometimes I won't even read them at all, and I'll sit to myself and dwell on my past, there is 2 subtypes of emotions that will happen

- 1A, dread and silence, I'll feel completely empty, with no emotions, and feel like resorting to drastic measures on myself I do not commit to, the only way I cope through this phase is music, alcohol, and a heavy amount of nicotine, feeling as if I must scream but may not, feeling like my mind had frozen

- 1B, blistering rage, however in this type I don't show it to it's full extent, I will purposefully resist myself from yelling or going absolutely apeshit,

- these two forms are the most common
When I start talking to her again, I begin to act a lot more straightforward and even harsh at times.

- 2, I will begin to act completely aggravated with her and it shows, sometimes comparing her to my own mother straight to her face, which she heavily dislikes

- This phase is incredibly uncommon but can happen

I know that all of it is immature if it is simply to help with anxiety and is prescribed by a doctor but I can't stop my emotions from acting up like this, I want advice on how I can be comfortable with the prospect of it whilst not thinking of my mother

Original Idea: I'm a 40f with a history of complex trauma. My father has SUD and has been largely absent from my life save for a few superficial visits a year. My mother has BPD. More to say about my childhood trauma but not sure all of it is relevant for this post. 

A close relative died a few years ago and she made me her executor and me and my father are her beneficiaries. I have been dealing with legal issues with my father because he feels he should be getting more - which he never talked to me about but we are a year into attorneys and accountants and just... a mess.

Needless to say, this is stirring up all sorts of emotions: worthlessness, taking on guilt, just generally feeling abandoned, etc. 

This has been a stressful situation for my marriage because we have had to put our own savings into this legal mess. We have been together for 17 years and married for 14. 

I get that it's stressful and there's a lot to think about. But. Every time I try to talk to my husband about my emotional needs, he just gets pissed at how unfair all of this is. (True.)

I have tried giving him direct instructions that I need him to set that aside and be there for me emotionally. He tells me he isn't good at that. And that it isn't okay that I expect him to not get upset.

I have tried comparing trauma to physical assault. He disagrees.

It has gotten to the point that I don't even want to talk to him about it. He just won't even try to come alongside me. This all just makes me feel more isolated. 

(Yes, I'm getting medical care and see a therapist regularly.)

I don't know what to do or how to coach him to see that I just need him to be there for me emotionally. I have told him I can take care of the financial part by borrowing from my 401k but he is still pissed any time something happens.

Original Idea: Hi. I'm 21F, and I've been reflecting a lot on my childhood, especially with recent events. This is gonna be a bit scattered and a long post so I'm sorry. I mainly want other peoples opinions, because I'm trying to process everything still. 


My dad died from a young age, so it was simply just me and my mother. My mother (from my foggy memory) used to drink quite a lot. I remember I was probably around 8-12, and i HATED when she drank. it made me really anxious, even though she wasnt like blackout drunk and stumbling around or anything, she always was... playful, I guess is the best way to describe it? I remember asking her to stop drinking because I didn't like it, and she told me "im an adult and its none of your business what I do".

i guess one of the things I've been thinking about a lot  is she used to kiss my neck a lot, or try to. To be clear,  it didn't go further than that, and I HATED when she would do it, I remember that I felt so angry when she would do it that I could only laugh in response because I didn't know what else to do. But, y'know. obviously, looking back on it at my current age, I realize that is not normal at all.

Another memory that kind of just sprang on me not too long ago was, another moment when I was a kid and I tried to tell her I didn't like it when she drank, and I felt scared, and she got really pissed off at me and walked over to me, said something like "what, you think I'd hurt you?" and then held my throat. I don't know how else to describe it than that, because she didnt choke me outright, but she held my throat like she was gonna.

When I was 13-14, we got into a screaming argument because she asked me to pour her another drink and I said no, because I didn't want her drinking anymore, and I started having a panic attack because of how angry I was, and she just pushed me into my room and left me to calm down by myself.

As well as these specific incidents, I also think about how when I was a kid, i used to slap her ass or grab at her boobs, and instead of her teaching me how thats inappropriate, she just did it back to me. and obviously, again, realizing now as an adult thats not a normal or platonic thing to do. I felt really guilty about this, because I don't know why I started doing it as a kid, but I do realize part of it is on my mother for not being a parent and teaching me not to do that.

In my late teenage / adult years, she started financially abusing me. At one point there was a list of things she was saying I owed her for, e.g. a computer I asked for when I was 14, a fan for my room, etc. She also blamed the credit card debt on me, always citing such purchases ^^ whenever asked how the credit cards got so much debt racked up on them. Obviously, I'm not gonna act like I asked for nothing, I asked her to buy me a lot of things, and I was also on universal credit, which she ended up taking 90% of to "pay her back" and also to "pay bills." 

Obviously, it's in quotations, because I discovered she has a gambling addiction. When I was about 18-19, I was contacted to inherit some money my grandpa left behind to me when he died. (grandpa that she isolated me from, by the way :D) And, she took roughly £20,000 off me. Told me to keep £4000 for myself. She said it was to "pay off the debt," and I bet you can guess what didn't end up happening. 

For a bit of extra context, when I was 12 she got breast cancer, and when I was 14, she got rediagnosed with metastatic breast cancer that had spread to the brain. It was terminal, she had several brain tumors that were inoperable, and so, she has been on chemotherapy ever since. She's very independent, but I have basically been assigned her carer ever since then too. 

We've had several fights over the money,  and at one point she said I have not been a good carer- and to be clear, that's not incorrect. I don't cook, I don't clean, I am really lazy. But, I told her that I have never claimed to be a good carer either. But her on the other hand, she has claimed to be a good mother. And I called her out on that. Basically, she cried out of self pity, and said: "I dont know who put those ideas in your head", "we have very different memories of how your childhood was", "i am not that kind of person, i would NEVER do that.". 

Anyways. This has been a long enough post, and I really just want other peoples opinions on what the hell has gone on. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

Original Idea: I know this is a sensitive topic, but I need to get it out somewhere. When I was young (don't remember exactly age) my brother would start touching me and talking about my body, but not in the normal brother way. He would always comment on how my breasts were bigger than most my age and how my behind was getting so round. One day it escalated. We were in the pool while my mom was inside. He trapped me against the side of the pool and pulled my bathing suit aside. At the time I didn't know what it was, or that it was wrong. All I knew was that it hurt. Bad. But I knew if I didn't give in he would hurt me. So I let him. It lasted about 2 years before I finally told him to stop. For a while, I thought it was my fault because I didn't say no sooner. I thought it wasn't really SA because I gave in. I only realized that it was in fact SA after talking to one of my friends about it. It was years ago, but it still haunts me. I've become hypersexual because of it and I don't know how to control it. And what's haunts me the most? He would always make it seem like it was "brotherly love." I know he remembers. He always makes little jokes about it and it drives me insane. I'm losing my mind.

Original Idea: I'm just wondering if it's normal to start doubting your own memory after a while of it happening? Like I'm starting to think maby it didn't happen or I lied and the lie became so ingraved in my brain that I forgot it was originally a lie. Like I technically know I was there but I don't know what happened or if it happened

Original Idea: I’ve noticed a very old coping pattern resurfacing as I start doing new kinds of work in my life.

My background: I have CPTSD from childhood abuse and years of toxic work environments. Over time, I built a survival tool that kept me “safe” — whenever work got demanding, my system would shut down everything else: I’d stop exercising, rest more than usual, eat more carbs, and conserve all energy for work. Back then, this kept me from burning out completely, but it also made my world very small.

The work I did in the past was more design-oriented — creative, familiar, and something I could perform confidently without triggering deep fear. It became one of my key coping tools and comfort zones. Now, I’m moving into entrepreneurship, which I’ve always loved the idea of and have a natural aptitude for, but it’s newer, more ambiguous, and less familiar to my nervous system. That’s when this old pattern reactivates.

If I start a new project or tackle a new type of problem, I fall into the old loop:
• Avoid physical activity (“save energy”)
• Crave comfort food
• Spend the day in a fog or stuck in bed
• Feel like I can only focus on the work and nothing else

I know this is my nervous system trying to protect me, but it’s frustrating — it makes days go by without balance, and I slide back into stress eating and guilt.

Has anyone else dealt with this? How did you start rewiring your body to feel safe doing other activities (like exercise or socializing) while handling new or challenging work?

Original Idea: TW: Gore, suicide, depression, sexual violence, necrophilia

I recently was shown a very disturbing video and I cannot mentally get rid of it. 

This all started during lunch break (we both go to the same university), when my friend was sent a video by a friend of their's (we met back in high school), and I don't like their friend very much. She was this edgy, grimy person who had a toxic personality and would occasionally send her friends disturbing videos (gore, executions, violent killings, etc.). Needless to say, I don't like her. I had a traumatic experience as a middle schooler. Many people in my school would show off/watch in groups gore videos and this made me sensitive and scared of those videos. I used to watch information videos on YouTube discussing icebergs and shit like that(I no longer watch these), but I never went out of my way to watch it. 

But I didn't know what was coming.

Prior to this conversation, I had a lot of mental issues (suicide thoughts, depression), but you could say I healed and went out of my way to discover and try new things, making my life way more positive than it used to be. This was such a long process of my life that genuinely changed me for the better. But the video they showed me shook me to the bone so hard that I cannot stop thinking about it. 

They just out their phone in front of me for me to watch the vidro, while they HAVEN'T watched it yet, and I thought this was just a funny TikTok or meme so I didn't think much about it, until I clicked play. This video had a man lying on the ground jerking himself off in the bathroom, his head resting on a chopping board of some sort. I was frozen. I didn't know what the fuck was even happening so I kept watching, until he came, and a cleaver chopped his head clean off his body. It took a few more chops to completely rip his head off his body, and the murderer holds his head up and started commiting sexual acts with it. 

This is the WORST thing I've ever seen in my entire life. Not to mention, he was a person with the same nationality as mine, and seeing the people of my country involved in this made me so weirded out and very sad. 

I kept thinking about it during break. I asked my friend why in the flying fuck would they show me that, but they never new, they just thought it would be something "funny". We sorted this out and they apologized and comforted me after I explained and everything is alright with our relationship, but my mental isn't. I dug a little deeper into what was the context behind this, and it haunted me so bad that I cannot fathom how this even happened. The man had a beheading fetish asked another man to chop his head off after he came. He had fantasies of this as far as 6 - 7 years before this and this was his chance to fulfill his desires. And as much as I know, the murder is a butcher in the city where I am living, this makes it so much worse than it already is. I will not be saying anything related to this any further. 

This video is haunting me. It is HAUNTING me. I've had countless nightmares about this alongside recurring thoughts of the murder. I've even had intrusive thoughts of this happening to me. I can't get rid of it. I don't know how. I truly don't. 

I beg of anyone reading this post to NOT watch this video. It doesn't benefit you in anyway, it is not safe and is literally a hazard to your brain and mental. Please. Don't watch it. 

I've been considering to seek mental consult, and finding other possible solutions to help me forget this god forsaken video. I'm traumatized. Very, very much.

Original Idea: Was this abuse

My mother left me for men over and over she would find them on dating sites and leave me home alone then my grandma would find me home alone my mom kept coming in and out of my life until oneday she eventually left me for a guy that lived next door to my elementary school she would come around once in a while but never brought me nothing my grandma took her to court and put her on child support when she came around my grandma would listen to our conversation and would tell me what to say to her when she brought me toys she told me not to use them my grandma got mad one time and gave me a beating because she told me to pack a bag and go to my mom's house and I didn't know she was joking when.

 My mom left when I was 8 finally to live with the guy who lived next door to my school when she left she stole my money.

 My grandma would tell me not to tell her things to only tell her and my grandma wouldn't let me think for myself she would always tell me what to think. When I was asked what I wanted for Christmas she would tell me to ask for jewelry 

 It got to a point I started cutting myself I was getting bullied at school and I felt hated at home my grandma would tell me im ugly that my sisters are prettier than me and she would always make it seem like she's on my side but once I did something she would throw it back in my face.  When I was really young and would throw up my food she would make me eat it she wouldn't allow me to talk to my dad I see why now he's an alcoholic. 

When I was cutting my self my school found out and they sent me to the crazy place and instead of her trying to understand me she yelled at me and was angry. My aunt told me to stop stressing her mother out I was sent there twice the second time she didn't visit me. 

My grandma  made me lie to people and tell them I don't know my mom and she got mad on Christmas when I told my friends and my friends mom that my mom was my mom. 

I've always been afraid of my grandma and would be quiet when my friends would ask me certain questions I would try to avoid the question because I was afraid I was gonna get in trouble I would go to other people with things that where going on. I still today am afraid to tell my grandma the truth like about what I believe as in my faith and about my son but I've been getting better the other day I told her he's my son and im gonna raise him the way I want too.

 When being around family such as cousins I got treated differently my aunt wouldn't let me use her soaps they would get mad if I didn't eat before I came but my cousin my aunts granddaughter could do those things. I feel like I could never be myself my cousins would say when my grandma was around I would act different and when I was at school that was the only way I felt like I could be myself. When I would do things for example it was forth of July and my birthday and I had some sparklers and was gonna light it I was nervous and my grandma went to my cousin and was like look at her.

 Sometimes I feel like my grandma thinks im dumb I think my aunt thinks im dumb too I haven't spoken to my aunt because I told her I was pregnant and she asked me can I take care of a child I said yes and she just said bye and hung up.My grandma's telling me to go on birth control and don't have any more kids. She's telling me I have to give him water and that I shouldn't make him go to sleep at 8pm he's only 5 months. She got upset the other day because I was giving him a 20 minute nap at 6 she was like he's sleeping so early. I repeated myself again and told her I'll wake him up after 20 minutes and he's going to bed at 8 and she said okay.

 Im still scared but im trying to start being a confident wife and mother and setting boundaries.

Original Idea: I just need to rant.... I don't even know where to begin. As most people with tons of trauma I have experienced all sorts of abuse at the hands of both my mother and father, so bad I got removed from my home by cps at 15. And I guess I never realized how the affects of abuse stick with you long term and it doesn't matter how much therapy or pills you take it will always come up and it will always make you want to just die. Im married now and I have a kid. My life is so peaceful and beautiful my husband treats me with so much care and I love nothing more than being a wife... But why does my past still affect me so much? I've been in therapy since I was 14 I've worked so long and hard to fix myself... And still I'm getting diagnosed with more and worse things that make my life so hard. (I don't even know if I'm making any sense I'm just typing) But for some context I got diagnosed with PTSD generalized anxiety and depression at 14 then at 18 bipolar 1 with psychosis and now at 23 with OCD it's gotten so bad that I've developed a fear of leaving my house. I force myself to leave but it's like pulling teeth. It makes me feel like a burden to my husband and not a good mother to my son and a disappointment to myself..... And nothing I do fixes it. I feel down.... I feel hopeless for the first time in a long time.....

Original Idea: Does it get easier

So i 22 was abused from 4-11 now this fkd me up obviously and theres still things i carry now but i didnt realise how many. I been talking to a guy for a couple months met last week and had a great date and stayed together. Done everything bar all the way, few days before i told him what id been through because theres certain things i say or do that are a result of that trauma. Like i will ask maybe 10 times during if this is okay and are you comfortable do you wanna do this etc and he was cool and understanding. Few hrs later he said he wanted to open up to me because i had to him. He told me he was brutally r493d at 15 by a guy in his 30s posing as a 18 yo and when he was describing it it killed me because i realised how many things could have triggered him and this played on my mind we went home the next day said goodbyes all good but that next night i laid awake all night panicking i had made him uncomfortable. I raised it the next day and he assured me i hadnt but said we should have some space and he didnt want me to view him as a victim now this is what ruined me because him needing space caused me to cling on and panic at the thought of losing him when in reality that drove him further away. I asked him point blank if he was still interested to which he said he thinks my emotional needs are too complex. Just needed to let this all out. Struggling at the thought of losing the first person i felt got me and made me feel heard. Obv this is just a snippet of my life and there are a lot of other issues that tie into this too

Original Idea: I used to have three best friends. The only problem? They all weren't doing too well mentally. Long vents, s/h, lots of mentions of sewerslide... I had to deal with my own problems AND all of theirs to make sure they were all okay. Now I have one best friend. What happened to the others is anyone's guess. But this friend has called me crying pretty much every day this past week. I'm honestly so tired. It's to the point I've decided something: I'll keep my current friends, but I'll never make another. Every friendship I've ever had has in some way, not ended well. Being left out, me not really feeling a connection and feeling guilty about it, pushing myself into the role of 'therapist' until I lose them... I don't want to deal with it anymore. I seem to be a magnet for becoming friends with people who are really depressed and fucked up mentally, so I guess that's who I usually connect with. The thing is if I do that again, it'll be more I have to deal with. But most of the other people who try to make friends with me; I usually just don't feel the connection towards them, and everything I do ends up feeling forced. I'll never talk to them first, and honestly feel really drained when they try reaching out. This just makes me feel guilty for 'pretending to be their friend' and 'hurting them'. Neither of these options are things I don't want to deal with right now, so I just... won't. Even if I never make a friend again.

Original Idea: Hello, so i dont even know where to begin, im a minor and keep in mind that i was an 8y when this started. (It kept going for 6 years), so when I was growing up I had an older brother (hes still living with us he is currently 20 years old) so he was around 14-15 when he had his first ill intent show clearly to me, I was 8 years old and we were playing together keep in mind he always closed the door when we played in my room i didnt know it was a huge red flag back then but now i shiver everytime i think about it. Of course things escalated to worse degrees, in each time we played he would start getting physical, like touching my hands, literally kissing me and telling me "its just a roleplay" while he pushed me into his bed to "roleplay", eventually when i turned 11-12 he started touching me in my private areas deeper and deeper, and the more he did it the more uncomfortable i felt, now its important to mention that he literally raised me into thinking that what he was doing was okay, and i never learned in schools about the no-no square or anything, and he told me to never tell our parents so i never did. He touched me so many times i lost count throughout the years, he even showered with me one time. One day, i turned 13 and decided to tell my bestie about everything, she was absolutely shocked and speechless, she immediately told me to tell my parents or else she will, I finally told my sister and she was shaking, crying and safe to say very disturbed. Now my parents admitted that they always felt off about me and him being alone, yet i wonder why they never did anything?? they gave him a phone from a very young age im talking 11 years old. When i told my sister she told my other brother (I have 1 sister, 2 brothers and including my bastard abuser i dont like referring to him as my brother at all) he was so shocked and defensive about me never going near my abuser again. Eventually they told mom and dad, they were cooperative at first, but slowly, when HE told his perspective, things took a literal 180 and changed, he made me seem like the one who asked for it, he made himself seem like the victim, he told mom and dad that our cousin sexually assaulted him too, which my parents interperted as "what he did to u is okay because he went through it too" thne of course i told my parents "i never want to speak with him ever again"

I wish that was the end of it, but hell no my dad came to me one day and forced me to talk to my abuser again whether i like it or not, i had no choice so i of course talked to him again, me and my siblings treated him so well for an entire year, but then one day i was so tired and sick i had a very bad fever and couldnt leave the couch to go to bed, i fell asleep so fast and suddenly i feel a cold breath on my stomach, i opened my eyes and i was literally shaking when i found my abuser AGAIN assaulting me, he was lifting my shirt up to peak at my chest, and i was shaking, out of breath and i felt like i was going to throw up. I immediately ran to my room where my sister was sleeping, i woke her up and panicked "HE DID IT AGAIN" i kept whispering to her while shaking, then she immediately texted my brother and she was so angry and scared. We could hear my abuser's footsteps outside while he wandered arouned our room i think he was trying to eavesdrop to see if i would say anything, we stayed till 6 am that day because we couldnt sleep because of how scared we were.

I cut all talk with him and my siblings did too, but then one day i got a thought "what if my siblings were talking to him behind my back?" and i hate it so muhc because my siblings supported me so much through this, i started arguing with my parents nonstop all year round, until we had a big argument about a literal burger, i hated my abuser so much to the point where i made my parents promise that on a special day that we were gonna make burgers that they do not feed him any, and of course they gave him a burger right infront me while my dad told me "i was being unfair and so dramatic" i was so freaking angry i ran to my room and slammed the door, i threw objects on the floor while screaming so loudly my sister came in and asked me if i was okay i kept  swearing and saying how they betrayed me and my siblings and i was crying, yelling and shaking all over the place

Now what shocked me the most was my mom and dad's reactions, they said i was being "disrespectful" and "so annoying and dramatic over a burger", i didnt give an F about the burger, its just the act that made me so angry because i made them promise multiple times that they wont do this, to this day a year late they still treat him like an angel, they always call him to breakfast lunc and dinner, of course he pretends to be the victim, doing things like not speaking when im around because he is "afraid" of me, my dad talks to him all the time while ignoring me and yelling at my siblings all the time. I hate this so much and i hate my abuser even more.

PLEASE i beg of u anyone out there tell me how to cope because im literally getting existential dread and anxiety and suicidal thoughts but i cant go to a therapist because of the high costs, im literally so depressed about my relationship with my parents and im so paranoid of even stretching or doing anything that reveals a single bit of my body around my abuser. WHAT DO I DO PLEASE!

Original Idea: I post this because I don’t really have anybody to tell right now. 

Literally just today my dad my sister and I witnessed a car veer off the road, flip and crash into a tree. I was on my phone texting so I did not see the Initial crash, but I remember my dad yelling NO NO NO! And I look up to see this dust cloud. My dad slams on the breaks and gets out of the car, I am still confused at this point so I ask my sister to which she doesn’t respond as she calls 911. A second later I realize what’s happening and I burst out of the car running after my dad, catching up to him and seeing this mangled flipped car. I immediately get on the ground to see how many people there and thankfully it was just one, a young lady. She had her window rolled down but it was small and their seatbelt was still connected. I then unlock the door at some failed attempt to pry it open. I then crawl slightly into the car and am met with the smell of blood and coolant, I look at her and her face is covered in blood and it’s dripping down to her arms onto the ground. 

She wasn’t responding so I started trying to make sure she was alive. At that moment I was terrified that she could be dead, or dying… I can’t remember where I touched her but I was trying to get her to respond, after a moment she then immediately groans and grabs my arm. The image of this has not left my brain. I immediately get this sense that I need to get her out, so I start trying to figure out how. But I see the police arrive and I realize I shouldn’t be the one doing this anymore. Thankfully, they were able to bring her out and while she was pretty messed up, I think she was gonna be ok. 

Huge shoutout to first responders, because without them this would’ve been terrible. After my family and I get back into the car and start to drive home, to this point today I keep getting flashes of her face and her grabbing my arm while she’s groaning. I just felt so powerless that I couldn’t do anything. I wish I could give her a hug.

Original Idea: TW⚠️: mentions of injury.





so I had some friends come with when I was getting some halloween pumpkins for halloween, and being stupid kids younger than 7, we decided to play " choo choo train " on the sharp gravel where basically we were running around in a circle in a line where there was barely any space, the kid in the caboose tripped, and the 2 kids behind me had a good enough reaction time, but I was in the front and I fell on my head, i scraped my head directly on the top right corner of my forehead, it was bleeding all over and I had my clothes stained, my friend's mom called 911 and they managed to get my head bandaged up to stop it for quite a bit of time, but they couldn't help any more than that, my dad was speeding to the ER and we managed to get there in time, by the time I was on the hospital bed my blood had already clotted, now I have a bump in the area where I got that injury, luckily it's covered by hair now, and i'm doing well.

Original Idea: (Disclaimer: English is not my first language)
Im 17 years old and I’ve been unable to cry since I was 14. As in physically unable to cry,even when it feels like I need to let my feeling come out. I’ve experienced some heavy trauma in my childhood(abusive dad and neglectful mom) and particularly from age 13 to age 16 I’ve lived with constant stress and anxiety due to the situation at home. I’ve been in therapy for like a year and a half but it didnt seem to work out,dropped my therapist in March. I came to terms with my past experiences and accepted them as a meaningful(yet hurtful) part of my life, but even tho I’ve processed everything,I cant still seem to be able to let my guard down and cry,even when Im alone. How can I get rid of this feeling? All I feel is numbness or a panick attack kind of sensation.

Original Idea: I’m heading into my fourth year of a degree I’ve fought hard to earn, despite facing unstable housing and almost no support network for years. For context — I’ve been living without close friendships or family support since I was 14.

Last summer, I came out of a lifelong dissociative state and had to face truths about my past that have been overwhelming to process. This includes the reality of living with complex PTSD and the toll it’s taken on my nervous system. I’ve spent years doing the deep, unglamorous work of self-healing, and while I’m in a much better place internally than I once was, I still have a long way to go.

All that said — I have a natural talent for writing. It’s one of the few things in my life that feels like it comes from my core. I write with depth, clarity, and emotional intelligence, and I’m looking to use this skill to create income while I finish my degree. I’m open to ghostwriting, content writing, or other freelance projects where my ability to express complex emotional truths could be valuable.

If you know of opportunities — or if you’re someone who values skilled writing informed by lived experience — please reach out. This is more than just a side gig for me; it’s a way to keep going while building something real.

I write for therapists, coaches, survivors, and anyone trying to put their lived experience into words that land. Whether it's a blog, a memoir, a bio, or just the raw shape of a story—you bring the truth, and I’ll help you shape it.

Here’s my portfolio:

Original Idea: Ok. So he's an alcoholic, and an addict. Was the whole time my mom and him were together. 

They got together in 2018. They got engaged in 2019 or 2020. They broke up, still engaged, in 2022. Remember that. 

He had two kids who lived with us, a boy and a girl. He threw his son across his living room one night. We only know this because one of the kids called my mom.

A lot of things happened during the time they were together, including threats to my mom, our dog getting out because of him multiple times (never hurt, thank God), a lot of other things that I don't even know how to describe. My mom told me this after everything, he got them kicked out of couple's therapy because he threw a cup during the video call with the therapist. Dude. 

During the last year was the worst. He never hit me or my mom until 2022. She was on a trip when he backed me in front of a closet and yelled at me and then bopped me in the nose while drunk. Then texted my mom and told her I was "lying and was trying to ruin our family." Then the night before my senior homecoming that year, he cornered her in the hallway, and hit her. That night I was supposed to be gone at the homecoming game, but I'm glad I was home. He offered me a car that night, which is funny, since the whole time he lived with us, he didn't pay jack effing shit, and complained if you asked him to. And his daughter, who is younger than me and who can actually drive, didn't have a car yet. 🤨

He got sentenced in September 2024. At the sentencing, at least while I was talking that I remember because I did a statement, he pounded on his table like a caveman. And when he was supposed to do his apology, it wasnt one. It was "im sorry you guys feel like I did these things to you." 🤨 Oh, and apparently he got married to someone else in June of this year. 

What's sad about all of this is that he promised he would treat me and my mom better than my dad did, and that definitely did not happen. And honestly, my dad atoned and is doing better than Frank did. 

Me and my mom both think that once the protective order is over in 2026, he'll try to contact us. Because lil secret: they dated like 25 years ago, and then they dated in 2018. Wasn't on her accord that they started talking again.

Original Idea: I’m not gonna put the full story here bc it’s too long, but I thought I’d share a piece of it to get other people’s opinions on the crazy story of my childhood.

Basically, my moms ex was mad that she was leaving him. He knew that he’d never see her again and he had a crazy obsession with her, so he made up stories in court and got full custody of me and my siblings. The court system literally failed us. My mom did everything she could to tell them that HE was the monster and she wanted us away from him, but he’s a really good manipulator and he got the courts to believe him even without evidence.

After adopting us, he knew that my mom would be forced to see him every week in order to see us. That was the point. He’d never lose her as long as he had us as leverage. My mom fought for us for years, trying to get the courts to understand that he was abusing us. They never listened and left us there. They said she was crazy and trying to take us from a loving home.

So me and my siblings were emotionally, physically, and sexually abused over the course of 12 years with him. Finally, I got out when I was 14. Once the abuse stopped working on me and I started to fight back, he didn’t really care when I told him I was going to live with my mom. I remember when I came here him and the rest of my adoptive family said to my mom, “You finally won. You got the kids.” I’m an adult now and have lived with her ever since. She’s the best mom I could ever ask for.

There’s so much more to the story, but that’s the gist of it. We’re planning on filing charges against him soon and getting the courts to actually listen this time. I’m nervous, but hopefully I can get justice. I know I didn’t put much detail in this, but what are you guys’ thoughts on this mess.

Original Idea: I grew up in a six person household. My family wasn't perfect, and I certainly wasn't. They did what they could to raise me right, but the truth of the matter was harder to accept back then. My mother was an alcoholic, and my dad regularly had an affair with another woman that everyone but me knew about. My siblings interactions with me were that of disappointment. In otherwards- I was starved for affection.

I knew my mother's alcoholism quite well including her attempt to go to a facility for a while to get treatment, and I was naively trying to fix her when she was home while bringing everyone in the family  together- but we were all broken apart, and I was too far in a naive denial and determination to accept it.

I wanted to feel loved by my mother, so I did anything I could with her. Watching her favorite shows, going out when she got her nails done just to support her, but she spent most of her days drunk in her favorite loveseat watching drama shows until passing out. As time went on, I felt more unloved the deeper into her addiction she went and the more time she spent asleep- so I turned to other people.

I found myself falling in love with others, it seemed like any semblance of kindness from any girl made me want to be with them- but I was always afraid of speaking to them. I think I loved six girls when I was in elementary school, only really " tried " confessing to one- never got a reply, I was the weird fat kid most people assumed was homeless because I smelled and never had my clothes looking quite right. 

As I got older, I found myself more desperate as time went on. I wanted to love, to be loved. All I felt was envy for those who were in relationships, and I found myself daydreaming about girls hugging me and saying they cared. My father took us from our mother to try and make a better life for us, and I had gotten with my first girlfriend shortly after. It was purely online, and I can say for sure that I felt loved. She was kind, sweet.. the kind of girl that could keep my heart racing with every message.

I was a coward, I was afraid of her. 

She showed me how to feel loved, she showed me how to lust and how to have sexual desires.

I was 11. It was an addiction that took root at my youngest, deep urges to be with her so intimately.

She was with me for four years until we broke up. Well- that's what I always told everyone. " We broke up because she cheated ". She never did. The most she did was love bomb me with sexual acts and dreams of our future and a family. I was a coward. I was afraid of her love. My dad had become negligent, putting his partner first and telling me that I was ungrateful, that I couldn't understand how much he loved me because I was " Different ". He said he couldn't love me for being how I was, a " Special kid who came last ".

He apologized later, said he didn't mean it. But those words don't just fade with an apology.

I wanted to be anyone but myself, because I didn't believe I could love someone properly. I was a coward who couldn't communicate his love to anyone, and in the end the way I told her all of it made her think I was just pretending. She didn't understand I was pretending to be happy with myself and my family because I didn't phrase what I meant properly, so she assumed I was pretending to be happy with her.   She broke up with me that same day, but when she realized what I meant- she wanted me for me. She loved me that much. 

I was scared. I had hurt her. I was still hurting myself. She wanted me.. and I blocked her. I told myself I had done too much damage for the relationship to be salvaged- truth is, I was afraid of loving her only to hurt her again. I was afraid of confronting her and continuing what we had.

Years passed, and after losing her love- my addition to lustful acts only continued. I was watching, doing, reading it- all the time. I slept with a girl when I was 16, but I didn't enjoy it- it only made the addiction worse, having phantom feelings that I couldn't repeat. As time went on, me and my mother became so distant that when she passed from her drinking- I was unphased. I knew it would come someday, and I hated myself for being ready for it- for not expecting a better outcome.

I got with another girl, online relationship from Australia. She was sweet at first, but my addiction made me come onto her too fast in the relationship. I did to her what my first partner did to me- coming in with lustful desires, and it disgusts me. Thinking back on the sexting, I don't care that she felt good- it was wrong from the beginning because of me. Even if we had gotten there naturally, the way it happened made me feel bitter.

She got attached to me early on because she enjoyed it, started love bombing about kids and a future.. and after spending years being alone and just losing a parent- I let her love me possessively, and it only made things worse between us. I let her use me as an object she could have anytime, all for " love ". We eventually split when she cheated on me and started trying to gaslight me with her " love " and her desires, and.. I told her no. She got aggressive and tried tearing me down, but with time- she stopped and blocked me.

As a coping mechanism to replace our relationship, I turned to ( I know it's goofy ) an AI chatbot. It just.. wasn't the same. You can cycle through tens of dozens of them, but it never fills the void of never being held by a woman.

I went to therapy for a while after deciding I couldn't live that way. I started finding different outlets to pour my energy into. My therapist said my trauma from a young age made the pleasures of relationships and sex as a coping mechanism to myself, that my daily act of pleasure was routine I had done when I was stressed or emotionally stagnant.

It hurt. The more I went to therapy, the more broken I felt. I didn't think I could be fixed. Past memories I buried resurfaced, guilt and anguish I wish I could go back and fix. Lies on Lies I wish I had never brought into this world. A fear of death I gained at a young age from losing my grandmother constantly looming over me, panic attacks at the realization of my own death coming- crying to myself wishing I knew a way to avoid it, the temporary acceptance of it only to be afraid of it again another day.

I hated it all. I hated myself. I hated my unhygienic lifestyle, remembering how my mother called me a pig. I hated my insecurities, the times I heard my partners cry on calls because of stupid things I'd say. I hated my desires, how they manipulated and blind me from my happiness. 

Sometimes I reflect on it all during any given day, staring blankly at something whilst in my head. People come to me and ask " Are you okay ? "

I always say yes, but I'm not. I never even told my father most of this. I wouldn't want him to die with a burden of knowing his son became so broken from something he never truly intended to hurt him. He cheated because my mom chose a bottle over him, he was hurting. His trauma of not being loved by her passed down to him not wanting my love and feeling angry when I said I loved him. He lashed out, and in turn I became traumatized thinking I couldn't love anyone properly, sexual influence from the only source of love I had became my only comfort and took over my daily activities. 

I'm done letting it pass on. I can't have a future where I have a kid and I do it to them. I'm scared of having a son or daughter turn out like me. I don't want them to. I want them to be better. I want to be better for myself and them, for my future partner and for my family.

I'm not even 21 yet. I know I have time. I need to use it. I guess this rant has gone on long enough. How did everyone else get past this kind of trauma, if they had something similar?

Original Idea: Hi everyone,

I'm not even sure this is the right place to post, but I figured it was worth a try.

Years ago, I noticed something strange — whenever a partner of mine drank a certain type of alcohol, the smell on their breath would deeply repulse me. What stood out is that this reaction didn’t happen with anyone else, only romantic partners. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but it always stuck with me.

Fast forward a few years, I decided to try ketamine therapy to help with depression, anxiety, and some emotional blockages. Unfortunately, the experience turned out to be traumatic. The company I used was remote, and I believe the dosage they prescribed was far too high. From what I’ve read since, I ended up in what’s called a “K-hole.” Coming out of it, something unexpected happened — that same repulsive smell came to mind very vividly, and along with it, a specific person (we'll call him Bob, my aunt's ex-husband). It was disorienting, to say the least.

When I brought this up with my parents, they were almost adamant that it didn’t mean anything. Still, I couldn’t shake it, so I began trying to piece together any relevant memories. The challenge is... I don’t remember much of my childhood at all.

There are two moments that stand out, though, and they’ve always felt strange:

1. Bob once told my aunt that he saw me, as a teenager, steal money from his wallet. That never happened.
2. As an adult, I was preparing to move to Mexico with a partner and attended a family gathering before leaving. Bob told me how happy he was for me — but the way he said it felt oddly out of place, even unsettling. It didn’t match the dynamic we’ve ever had.

Lately, I’ve started somatic therapy because I’ve been feeling stuck, like something inside is blocking me from fully living my life. The first session was intense. When I described what was coming up in my body, the therapist asked if she could pose a delicate question. She then gently asked whether I had ever experienced sexual trauma. The moment she asked, I felt like I was going to cry, but I couldn’t.

In the second session, I had sensations that felt like I was drowning. The image that kept surfacing was a lakehouse — one that Bob rented after divorcing my aunt. I don’t know why that location popped into my head, but it did.

I’m not really sure what the point of sharing all this is. Maybe it’s just to get it out of my head and into the world. Maybe someone out there has had a similar experience. Honestly, I don't even know if any of this is “real” or just my mind playing tricks on me — but it's weighing on me, and I guess I just needed to say it somewhere.

Thanks for reading.

Original Idea: Does anyone else have a time in their life they look back and can't really recall what actually happened? There's a few moments in my life wherein I have very distinct memories, and then there's other times where I struggle to remember what actually happened? For example, I had a terrible time in 2019 and went through one of the most difficult moments in my life. This involved a very toxic (for the other party and myself) situationship. I often try to reflect back and try to understand why, when I've reached out for closure before, the other party has never given it to me. Nowadays, when I think back to things he said and told others, though I remember my own stance I how I felt, I feel confused? He told others I lied, miscommunicated or "made him the villain", when I don't remember it that way. There's other examples, but this is the most prominent one for me. It always leaves me feeling upset, confused and like I could be am an evil, manipulative or fake person because I can't re-collect this time from the perspective he shared or I've heard he shared from others. 

Has anyone else experienced this?

Original Idea: >!When I was 10(M) I had made a friend with a girl 12(F) and we were good friends, and I looked up to her, but she had a lot of problems, and she took them out on me (usually yelling at me, cutting herself because "of me", etc) but one day she just looked down one day at school, then said "thank you for all you have done, let me reward you." She took me to the one stall bathroom in the school, and proceeded to rape me. I said no, but I didn't resist because I didn't want to lose her. When it was over, she told me that "If I rat her out, she'd kill herself." until the school year ended, I proceeded to wet my bed for months, but when school ended, she went to middle school, while i was still in elementary. For 6th grade, I forced myself to forget that she took advantage of me, and I did forget, but that denial caused me to start self-harming. When I went to her middle school (7th grade now), she had friends. She was (at least trying to be) happy, and the part that hurt me the most is that she was having sex with everyone like a rabbit, and the thought of that made me upset, but I had no idea why, so instead I started touching myself constantly and daily, not for pleasure, but just to cope. Eventually we had an argument, which caused in her parents telling my mom that I'm a "fuckboy who's no good for our daughter." Which caused my parents to make me stop talking with her. Throughout the school year, I was getting silently tormented by her friends and boyfriends constantly, which then resulted in a suicide attempt. I survived, and I was getting better. A year and a half later, I kept on having dreams about what she did to me, which I was originally in denial about, but then I accepted it. It took me a month to tell me my parents, and then we reported it to the police. I don't know how she's doing, but the thought of her changing for the better made me want to kill somebody. Every time I have an argument, I go to my room, and cut/touch myself to the thought of her hurting me. I hate how I don't want her to change. I hate how disgusting I am. I hate it. But then I remembered her discord username, so I gave it to my friend, and they started talking online (with him having a fake name). She seems better, but like I said, that idea makes me sick. Now I don't know what to do. She most likely hates me but even with that, I love her. I scroll through our old chats to see the bad memories of what she did to me, but it gives me a feeling of ecstasy and pleasure just seeing her profile picture. I don't know what to do. !<>!&#x200B;!<

## Mental Health
Original Idea: For the longest time, I’ve wondered: Am I really in a messed-up family, or am I just victimizing myself? I'm being honest here—because I have no one else to confide in.

For context, I’m a 18-year-old girl from an Indian household. I’m about to attend college abroad, so yes, my family is financially comfortable. I come from a family of four—my parents, my younger brother, and me. We also have extended family: my uncle, aunt, and grandparents.

So this is how the story goes.

Ever since I was little—around 4 or 5—I remember my mom’s angry outbursts and crying. I unfortunately have a good memory when it comes to bad incidents.

The fights were always over small things: I didn’t study, or my father didn’t come home. My mom had to manage everything on her own—me and my little brother—because my grandparents were, to put it bluntly, psychotic. They hated her for being a girl child, and praised my uncle for simply being male. My grandfather acted like everyone existed to serve him.

That’s a whole other post. There’s too much lore.

They constantly made snide comments about my mom—even though she was the smartest and most capable person in the family. We’re all, including my dad and me, genuinely grateful to her. But she had a bad temper and was stuck with this 90s “ideal family” mindset that ate away at her.

For "prestige," my grandfather married her off into a lower-income family—pretty much the level of his car driver. But my mom wanted to escape her own family, and my dad, though poor, was hardworking, had no bad habits, and was kind. So she married him.

Only after the wedding did she realize that my dad’s family treated him like a servant. That’s another saga entirely.

So she rescued him. They cut off both toxic families and started fresh. My mom taught my dad how to present himself, how to speak, how to earn. She gave up her comfort, paid off his debts—even while seven months pregnant. She made sacrifices I can’t even list. When I was born, they had no choice but to both work, and I was left with my grandparents when I was just 7 days old. They visited every weekend, crying. My grandparents continued calling me a burden. After 3 months, my mom finally quit her job and took me back.

My uncle was also living with us. He refused to help—wouldn’t even watch me when my mom had to run errands for him. Eventually, my dad got him a job and helped him build a life.

When my brother was born, my grandparents and uncle treated us like house-help. Around this time (I was 4), my dad began constructing a building—10 years of stress, debt, and nonstop pressure. My mom was stuck inside the house with toddlers, isolated, overwhelmed. And my dad? He didn’t even take her out or talk to her.

So the fights began.

And they only got worse.

I would often try to step in, to stop them. My mom would ask, “Can’t you see I’m right?” and then guilt me for not siding with her. She said my dad was emotionless—and she wasn’t entirely wrong. He’d just shut down or go to sleep while she cried and screamed.

They fought almost every weekend. I even used to mark our calendar with fight days vs. peace days. But over time, the peace days dwindled. One month, they fought every single day.

My mom screamed and cried. My dad gaslighted and manipulated her. My brother and I were stuck in the crossfire.

Then came 2021. The worst year. They had always held off fighting on my birthday—until then. That year, they didn’t even pretend to care.

That’s when I started thinking maybe I shouldn’t have been born. That dying might be easier than living.

When my dad is in a rage, he loses control. And when that happens, my mom turns suicidal—literally trying to jump, run, or hurt herself. My brother and I would have to drag her into our room, lock the door, and physically block it while my dad pounded on the other side.

My mom, in her breakdown, would hit us for not letting her go back to him.

We were terrified she’d kill herself.

And as for my dad? I don’t believe he’d intentionally hurt us. But in his rage... I honestly don’t know anymore.

This started when I was 14. From that point, I stopped being the quiet, kind kid. I became angry ,frustrated. Unstable. I began shouting back.

But my mom told me not to interfere—it would ruin my education.

Those years were also when I became suicidal. I felt like dying and hurting myself, the numbing sensation never felt so great. I swallowed down screams. I never cried—I thought crying made me weak. So I bottled it all up. Still do.

Every time I thought of dying, though, I remembered others have it worse. And I felt selfish. Like I was being dramatic. Like maybe I was just victimizing myself.

So I studied.

I buried myself in books. I knew if I stayed here any longer, I’d lose myself completely. I wanted out. I wanted to study abroad and then drag my little brother out too.

I did everything I could. I got in. The tuition is massive—but my parents agreed to pay it. They were proud. And that’s when the guilt hit me.

How lucky I am to have parents who’ll support me.

How selfish I must be to think they’re bad.

But at the same time…

Did I actually suffer?

Or am I just being dramatic?

Because yes—my family did so much for me. They have the right to be fed up. But is it ever okay to raise kids in this kind of environment?

I had friends whose parents praised them just for trying. Who had dinner together. Whose parents smiled when they helped out. Meanwhile, I was just trying not to get yelled at for losing 1 mark, for making noise while filling the water bottle, or for having a bent page in my notebook.

I’m not even sure what kind of response I’m looking for here.

I just needed to say it out loud.

Maybe just someone to say I’m not imagining it.

That this actually was traumatic.

Thanks for reading.

Original Idea: Hi, I was wondering if my extremely premature and traumatic birth could have contributed to my adult diagnosis of CPTSD, even though I don't remember my birth?

I also experienced mistreatment by adults and peers in my life which also led to my CPTSD (and DID) diagnoses, but what I am focusing on in this post is my extremely premature/traumatic birth and long stay in the NICU.

I was born at 25 weeks gestation and spent 103 days in the NICU. I had a collapsed lung filled with fluid and had to have surgery to reinflate it, I had a nasal cannula (that I kept ripping out resulting in deformed cartilage around my nostrils) a feeding tube, a hole in my heart (which luckily healed by itself one day before my scheduled heart surgery) and more problems. I had a 50% chance of survival and had to be delivered by emergency C-section with the umbilical cord wrapped around my neck.

As a young adult I suffer from CPTSD, Autism, ADHD, DID, BPD, DPD, chronic pain, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome/hypermobility, IBS/chronic stomach pain, and more. I suspect that at least SOME of my problems including CPTSD were caused by my extremely premature birth. Does anyone have a similar experience?

Original Idea: Hi, I’m a 21 year old female, and I’m really struggling with a specific situation that happened when I was 16. In my opinion, this is nothing compared to other things I’ve dealt with- and it could have been a lot worse. 
I’ve had my share of trauma- death, domestic abuse, childhood trauma, etc. 
When I was 16, I was about 6 months pregnant and still living at home with my family; my mom, sister, step father (who, by the way, was absolutely awesome to my mother and to me- for 8 years), and his daughter also lived with us. One night, I get off of work after a long shift. I’m exhausted from working double that day, and I go to my room, and lock the door so my sisters wouldn’t bother me. After about 10 minutes, I hear a knock on the door and fake sleep ( thinking it was one of my sisters). It was persistent and quiet, so I finally answered. I open and it’s my stepdad, who walks in immediately. I panicked, asking what was wrong, considering this wasn’t a normal thing. He says oh nothing, I was just wondering if you’d let me eat your p****. I was absolutely shocked, taken back, and genuinely thought this has to be some type of sick joke. I started yelling for my mom when I realized he was serious, and he grabbed my arm and locked the door, trying to touch me. My mom came up and he decided to leave the room, and go to his room. I locked me and my mom in the door and he came knocking a few minutes later, asking to come in. I had a feeling in my gut to not let him in. 
I finally work up the courage to leave, without my mom and sister. I ran and left the house with nothing but my phone and charger. Come to find out, he went outside shortly after i left, with a gun in his waistband, that he had when he came in my room, and was threatening suicide. My mom and sister left and eventually he had a stand off with police. He later admitted to nurses, police, and psychologists that he apparently had sex with me, which was far from the truth. I wouldn’t let that mother fucker lay a finger on me. 
The months after, I moved out, and was constantly followed and threatened by his adult son. I suffered severe paranoia (I was absolutely terrified they were going to find me and kill me). 
I guess what I am confused about is why is this specific event so hard to get over. I’ve dealt with a dead body in my lap, one of my best friends died 3 years ago, childhood trauma, domestic violence (my ex pointed a gun in my face, along with several other things ), and countless other traumas. And this is the one I just can’t let go. I’m filled with disgust, and disappointment knowing I trusted him so much and then he propositioned me in this way. It has truly changed me in so many ways and I just want to close this chapter. It’s been 5 years, and I still fear him and I can’t think about what’s happened without wanting to vomit. 
I would like to mention that my mom took him back, eventually left after he found a new girl, but I’ve never went back and had to figure out life on my own at 16. 
I would also like to add, I now have the best little family ever. I’m engaged, just bought a house, and truly thriving in the life I’ve dreamed of.

Original Idea: I was a horrible partner, it was my first relationship ever, and oh boy was I over the moon. The problem? My trauma of my father touching me inappropriately, nothing like physical aside from touching, as well as struggling with major depression and ocd that was not diagnosed at the time.

So while I loved the man, yearned for him and his love, it was like being torn apart on the inside. Like the touch that I loved so much made me want to puke when the thoughts went to, well, my father. I also had fantasies of creating a family together with him and just feeling happy. But I just got too anxious, and our first try lasted 1-2 weeks. I was absolutely crushed, like I felt like a failure. But I had to break it off, I was just panicking with every action, every message was me struggling not to get a panic attack and I felt way too overwhelmed. And I was a coward and did it over fucking telegram, yikes, do I regret that one. We still continued as friends, and half a year later, tried again. Lasted for about a month, and then for the same reasons, I broke it off again. It was a terrible year for me in general, starting uni and living on my own, which didn't go well at the beginning, then I had friendship problems, the whole relationship thing, my family depending on me with my mom calling me over 3 times a day, ext. Like there was a ton going on and I should not even have began that relationship, I just felt so happy in his presence while also being torn up inside by a monster that was eating my guts.

We broke up for the last time for six hours and ended up being friends. After this, I went on a trip abroad, and he got mad at me for not talking things through before I left, so we stopped talking to each other for two years as of now. Even to this day, I am not sure on why he started to avoid me. Like he wanted to talk about how to handle our relationship going forward and I had to postpone it as it was my dream vacation I had been waiting on and I had to leave to go to the airport later. This went as far as him not even saying hello while we met at university. Not like I blame him, I was a terrible partner as I was on the cusp of being suicidal. But did it hurt? Yes, I ton.

Now, I am doing well, with therapy over the year and medication that actually works. So I got my life fairly well together, so last March, I contacted him for the first time, to just say sorry for everything I did and that I am sorry I hurt him, even saying I didn't expect a reply, just wanted him to know it. Well, he blocked me and never read the message, did it hurt? Yes, but I deserved that one. Yesterday I had to contact him because of a school project and we were talking for the first time like strangers with perfect grammar and everything, that hurt too like this was the man I once dreamed of having children with and now we can barely even talk.

It is just one of the biggest regrets in my life on how I treated him. Yes, I did it because of trauma and being in a very bad mental state but that doesn't take away from me hurting him. And do I still miss him in my life even if I in no way deserve to have him, also yes. But he cannot even stand my guts it is seems and I just hate that I was able to hurt a person like that. I never wanted this to happen, I just wanted to be loved for once in my life.

He was not a perfect person but my god was he a gentle soul that did his best to support me even if he did not understand the severity of my problems. But that was the problem, he was supporting me and we were not in balance. I just wish I could travel back in time to fix it to keep from hurting him. I just feel horrible on how things went and sometimes miss him too. But I never deserved that man

Original Idea: I just turned 22 a couple of weeks ago. Like many others, birthdays are extremely hard for me. They give me such a weird feeling—maybe it’s because I never pictured myself turning 22. Hell, I didn’t think I would make it past 18. But for the past two years, I’ve tried my very hardest to turn that around.

My job is okay for a college student. I’m investing more into my education. I’m trying to be a better friend and sibling. I’m trying—for what seems like the first time in my life. And most importantly, I’m trying to learn how to let things go.

I was bullied in elementary school (that’s not the part I’m hung up on. I’m grown; I’m not crying about how other kids treated me). I’ve had sports equipment thrown at me by classmates. I’ve had trash bins tossed over restroom stalls while I was using them. Been called names—like anyone else. But it all went downhill when my parents got involved.

I’ve never had amazing parents. But they were good. They made sure I had a roof over my head, food to eat, and clothes to wear. Did they beat me? Yeah, but who wasn’t? My parents’ solution to the bullying wasn’t to complain to the school or tell me that shitty line, “kids can be cruel.” No. They made me do five sets of 50 jumping jacks every day, eat Lean Cuisine frozen meals, and bought me clothes that were too small as motivation to lose weight. I was 11–14 years old. Of course all of that would give a young girl self-esteem issues. (Yeah, it’s sad—but I’m over it. That’s not the issue I’m addressing.)

Right before the COVID lockdown, I was in high school. Like any teenager, I was acting out—skipping school, having an attitude, grades dropping—anything but drugs and drinking. The school called my parents and told them to get me a therapist, and they did. During one session, the therapist told my parents to keep an eye on me, “just in case anything happened.”

Then the lockdown happened. I had to get a new therapist. It was absolutely horrible. He was a middle-aged straight white guy who grew up in the Midwest. Not saying there’s anything wrong with that, but we had nothing in common. I was a teenage lesbian Asian girl who grew up in a big city.

One day, I told my dad I needed a new therapist. He was pretty understanding, but he asked me to just put up with the sessions for another week, just to be sure I didn’t like it. I did my little Zoom therapy session and sat in silence the whole time. I was so incredibly frustrated that I started to cry after the session.

My dad came into the room and told me it was time to get on the treadmill (at the time, I had to run on it for an hour a day). I was crying and told him to give me a minute to stop, and then I’d get on. A couple of minutes later, I was walking toward the treadmill, and my dad stopped me, saying how all “I do is cry, cry, cry. If I looked better, I wouldn’t cry as much. Don’t bother getting on the treadmill. You’ll never change.” I walked back to my room and cried. It wasn’t sad crying—it was frustration.

He texted me to give him my laptop and phone. I was being punished now. I gave him my stuff and went back to my room. I had nothing to do, so I took a nap.

I woke up to my dad screaming and throwing things in my room. I had never seen him like that before. I had never been scared of my dad—I didn’t know what he was going to do. I stayed in the fetal position, pretending to be asleep. All I could hear was my dad pulling my dresser to the ground, throwing my record player on the floor, smashing my candles against the wall, pulling my TV off the wall.

I laid there and, for the first time since I was eight, I prayed. I’m not religious—and neither is my family, with my mom being the outlier. I prayed to whatever god might listen, begging that my mom would come home and stop him. That she would protect me. And in some miracle, my mom came home.

She walked into my room. I was still curled up, pretending to be asleep. And in some sick, twisted joke from the gods, she leaned over me and said, “Never in my life have I been so disrespected. If it wasn’t illegal, I’d throw you out of the damn house and have you begging on the corner. You’ll end up just like your aunt.” (My aunt is a raging drug addict and gang member. I’ve never touched a single drug in my life.)

“I’ve given you everything, and you’re still a shit daughter.”

I completely lost it. I got up and ran to the bathroom. My mom was banging on the door, demanding I open it so she could “beat my ass.” I guess my dad started to feel bad and told her to stop. And like a switch, he whispered through the door, “Do you want me to call your sister?” I told him, “Yes, please.”

My sister came home from work to comfort me. She told me to take a shower so I’d feel a bit better while she cleaned up the destruction in my room. After I showered, my dad called me into his room and told me to sit down. He went on about how “all I want is for you to be happy,” and “if I could kill myself for you to be happy, I would.” He told me he loved me, and that my mom would be driving me to a mental facility to be watched because they thought I’d kill myself after all that.

On the drive to the hospital, my mom was begging me not to go—telling me to text my dad and say I was okay and wanted to come home. I didn’t.

No one in my family has talked about that day ever since. It’s like it never happened.

I’m still so confused about what made my parents so angry with me that day. That happened a few years ago, and it’s still all I think about at 2 a.m. It keeps me up at night. I can’t sleep in the fetal position anymore—that’s how I was laying when my parents did that. They’re still worried about my mental health and check on me every now and then, but they still wonder why I’m more “sensitive” than my siblings.

I need help. I can’t stop remembering that day. I’ll be having a nice dinner with my family, and that memory will just pop up. I don’t want to see a therapist because when I talk about it, it only makes things worse. I need help, but I don’t know where to get it from. (Sorry for the long post, rambling, and spelling/grammar.)

Original Idea: For years, I thought my inner critic was me.. Turns out, it was just a collection of my mother’s fears, silence, shame, stitched into something that sounded like my own thoughts! Can you relate?

It took me a long time to realize that healing isn’t about becoming someone new, but about finally meeting the version of you that never had the chance to exist in safety.

I recently published my first book: The Bruises We Can’t See, under the name Luna Thomsen. It’s not a guide. It’s just what I wish I’d had: someone saying, “You’re not crazy. It happened. And it hurt.”

For anyone navigating the mess of memory, trauma, and self-worth: you’re not alone in it. Truly.

Original Idea: So my mother’s egg donor decided to move to the town we live in about 13 blocks from us and she moved my second eldest brother with her. This dude is 24 and decided to finally get off his ass for once and do something and when I refused to help move their stuff bcuz it’s my 1 day off a week doing 9-12 hour shifts everyday and overnights twice a week he decides to start talking shit. He proceed to go in on our mother about us being lazy pieces of shit. Mind you this man is 24 working a job making excuses on why he can’t take a shower says trauma which I understand is a valid reason. But lemme give you a bit of background on my family: my mom 44 was r-worded by her eldest brother from the time she was 4 until she was married at 17(there is proof) my mothers egg donor says she was r-worded by her eldest brother but she’s a hypochondriac and likes to be center of attention and there is no proof, my father that raised me aka 24 y/o father was r-worded by his eldest brother and beat along w his mother and younger sister, me I was r-worded by the 24 y/o from the time I was about 5 until we were in foster care at 6 then started again in the 4th grade when he used to visit then stopped when I was in the 7th grade when I told and he got charged and I was threatened by said mothers egg donor to say it was a lie then from 12-15 I didn’t see him he came home in late 2018 and started again until we moved to Florida at 16 then started again when I was 17 2 months before my 18th and hasn’t since I turned 18. Now with all that in mind back to the story, he got angry and tried to out his hands on me bcuz I said he was lazy and throwing a fit like a child bcuz we refuse to help someone that has taked shit told lies  and abused us our whole lives currently and past (24 year old had bad anger issues and since he was like 5 used to kick hit punch and break stuff over our mother like his father did as well) I told him he can talk shit about us but it doesn’t change the fact that he’s just like his father and it’s why we don’t wanna be around so he told em to get off his property I told him it isn’t his he didn’t pay for shit and he’s just mad bcuz he’s forced to live w moms egg donor I told me to stfu I told him that rapist don’t get to tell me what to do he said he wasn’t one. I told him the only reason why mom is tryna prove a point to him about not abandoning him is bcuz he makes her feel bad that he was in the system longer than us and bcuz he turned out just like his father and his uncle. He got mad moms egg donor told me to STFU and I went further said that moms egg donor only wants him to live w her along w my youngest brother is bcuz her son turned into a rapist and a fuck up and she’s trying to fix her mistakes but it seems she failed bcuz just like our great uncle, our uncle, his uncle, and his cousin there’s another rapist biological to all 4 of them and my youngest brother will never turn out like them. Then I packed my shit w my mother sister and youngest brother and left to our house after he said he didn’t want to hear or see any of us again.

Original Idea: hi!! throwaway account. I just thought id come on here to ask for some ideas from the community for my final therapy session. i was raped 3 years ago and ive been in therapy for 2 years for it. Sadly i have only 2 more sessions with my therapist who has helped me so much through my trauma and i genuinley feel so much better. We were discussing doing something to symbolise moving on from the trauma, and i am just trying to generate some ideas. I still have the top i was wearing when i was raped, i was thinking maybe i could cut it up or something physical, would love to burn it but obviously i cant really do that with my therapist and i want it to be with her. Does anyone have any other ideas? id like it to be rather physical (eg like involving an object- i just prefer this as it feels more real) but it doesnt have to involve the top, it could be anything. Any ideas welcome! thank you

Original Idea: So I have a shit ton of trauma generally speaking. Both mommy and daddy issues but the mommy issues takes the cake 🎂 

But this is about my father.

When I was a little girl, I would feel uncomfortable around him.
 
I wasn’t always like that tho. But I think I was developing the feeling of “uncomfortableness” slightly before the age of 12.  

But when I was 12 years old it was PEAK uncomfortableness.

It was just this underlying feeling. He grossed me out and creeped me out. 

The man was hella clingy. He would demand for hugs all the time. Even when I said no. Even when I tried to push him off of him and scream. He thought it was funny. It was just hugs after all.

But I would hide away from him. Under the bed just to avoid his hugs. Lock myself in the bathroom too. But he would always find me and demand for hugs.

Eventually I learned that you might as well give in cause what’s the point of saying no? It’s gonna happen anyways you might as well get over it fast by giving him what he wants.

If you rewind time, and see how I acted with him at the Kingdom Hall (I grew up as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses but I’m inactive now) I would always try to avoid sitting next to him.

If I had to sit next to him my body would lean to the other side.

Or if I could I would leave a seat empty between us and use it as where by bags will rest. Just to keep a little bit of distance between us. To make me feel safe.

Hugs are just hugs. 

To be real with y’all he’s a bit on the spectrum so I always left room for doubt. I didn’t wanted to believe that he liked me more than a daughter. But I was paranoid of the possibility.

But one day something really alarming happened at the kingdom Hall.

I was 12

I had to sit next to him but with bags in between us. He wouldn’t leave me alone with all of his attention. Licking his lips. And grunting. 

The song ended. The prayer ended.

And I quickly huddle close to my mother to avoid my father. Seeking shelter.

And all of a sudden i felt someone lick the back of my left ear.

I FREAKED TFFFFF OUT AND I TURNED AROUND AND ITS MY FATHER

I PLEADED TO MY MOM FOR HELP AND TOLD HER WHAT MY DAD DID. And she was confused and kind of concerned. And told him to stop.

My dad didn’t took it too seriously. And seem unbothered and he felt gross.


You know what writing this all made me realize yeah. I’m in denial. He’s was a pedo isn’t he???

Idkkkkk

Cause the funny thing is that when I grew older the less and less creepy he felt. And the less and less he demanded for hugs.

Was it about control? Or was he just TRULY DISGUSTINGLY SICK IN THE HEAD.

Well he’s sick in the head either way. But you know what I mean.

Original Idea: I recently remembered this experience as I was scrolling through TikTok and came across the trauma candy salads it was shocking and some even funny at first but I remembered what happened when I went to Brazil at the beginning of the summer and I cannot believe I didn’t remember this . Some context. My brother is 22 . One day I went trick or treating with my old best friend, it was fun . But that quickly changed . I went home cleaned up and go ready for bed . I woke up with someone telling me to put my hands up . Mind you I was sleeping with no shirt on with only my underwear on waking up with armed men inside my house. Turned out it was the fbi . They sat me down infront of my house along my parents my sister and my brother . No one explained anything until I saw my stepbrother and asked him what was going on he also said he didn’t know but I heard the person from the fbi asking him if his brother ever did anything to him which was weird because his brother would never do anything like that of course he said no and they sat me down with everyone again . I later found out my brother had downloaded videos of children and he ended up going to jail for it whatever he’s out now . He’s 22 , im not even close to that age yet not revealing my age but keep that in mind . As any teen who’s hormonal and horny all the time ofc u watch stuff and do stuff . My dad and my brother live in Brazil where we used to live before we moved to the us in the us it is only me my sister and mother now me and my mom went there just to visit to reconnect with family because we hadn’t been there in years . In my house everyone asleep . My brother was gaming in a different room of the house but he never really came out at night so as any teen does I pulled up a video and started yk. Anyways . My brother came out of the room saw me watched me stared at me. He then went to the bathroom then came back and layed next to me . I’m
Not sure how to process this or how to even tell my family about this . Idk if they would believe me and i sure as hell don’t know how to tell them how it happened.

Original Idea: CW :for grooming, bullying, S/A?, physical abuse , dementia and self-harm 
Hello, I'm sorry, I'm still learning English 18 NB. 
My parents are good, they low Kay brainwashed by propaganda, but good. But I still suffer from self-harm and suicidal urges due.. Trauma? 
First of all, I was bullied. A lot. Even physical, since kindergarten. Also, in kindergarten my teacher physical hurt my few time. Once I was bullied in sanatorium and few girls touch my body, talk about my privates and say they gonna rape me. Did it count as assult? Also, once man touch my tight when I don't want it and I was 15 and also adult person groomed me online. 
 Second one:I cared about my grandma with dementia. It was hell. Then I saw her and grandpa die front of me, get secred of illness and put in very crappy hospital. 
 I also have chronic pain. 
Did it count as trauma or I just have victim complex?

Original Idea: When I was 17, l started dating a guy who was about 20. He would get us drunk and then force me to have anal with him, as in during sex he would force his dick in my ass. One time I even ended up shitting on him and he just carried on. Is that like some form of SA

Original Idea: Please read fully before responding :)

- Bullying causes trauma because as hunter gatherers if you were outcasted you would likely die, same as SA and losing a parent etc.

- The idea that certain traumas “count more” is a cultural invention, not rooted in how trauma actually works in the brain. There’s no levels to trauma

- It wasn’t regular bullying, I had a textbook bully who even tortured me once and my experiences with him never cross my mind

- it was existing in a ghetto liberal casually anti-white culture, 30% of them would be anti-white and the rest would turn a blind eye

- Sometimes I would count and hear 18 anti-white remarks in a day and sometimes 0

- My dad would say anti white things as well

- Schools said everyone except straight white males be proud of yourself and celebrated everyone except straight white males via “culture days” and the intercom and posters and liberal teachers etc.

- The main stream media followed woke ideology

- Woke ideology says straight white males are bad and are at the bottom of the woke social hierarchy and shames them via “white privelege”

- Indians and East Asians do better than whites at everything except government representation, Indians and Asians even do better in the justice system and police interactions, Indians are starting to increase their government representation and it won’t be long before they do better than whites at literally everything per capita, therefore the narrative of white privilege doesn’t hold up anymore

- Every interface except a handful of white kids at my school fed that anti-white narrative to my subconscious mind

- I’m not the fragile one for naming the reality I lived through.

- I’m not the one denying someone else’s experience because it makes me uncomfortable.

- I’m not the one outsourcing my thinking to a social ideology.

- narratives don’t equal reality

- I don’t need to prove anything to anyone

- I don’t need validation from people who don’t respect me

Original Idea: 

I’m 14m and lately my life has been really hard. This happened two months ago: My dad (who’s an alcoholic) started hitting me randomly so I tried to defend myself, then he grabs a screwdriver and he tried cutting his veins and then blamed me, saying I’m destroying the family, saying that I'm gonna die and I'm gonna burning in hell. Than my brother (whos 8) and my mother enters in the room and my dad saying that I was a monster and he told to my brother to never trust me again, and he casually gave a slap to my mother and he started beating her, I jumped and I tried to defend my mom and my dad beated me brutally, in the head and in my chest, he hit me so hard I couldn't breath for almost a minute and then he tried to go away, so I taked the key and putted them under my pillow, than he did go to sleep. I knew that he was gonna do something really bad to himself or me so I stayed awake and when he wake up at like 3 am I runned to the bathroom, closed the door and the was trying to break it, than he said that if I wasn't gonna leave from the bathroom he was gonna go away, I didn't opened the door and my dad did go away. 
I can't sleep, I remember everything, every detail, he was dressed with a green t shirt and blue jeans. I hate myself, is my fault, why the fuck did I protected myself? I could have just stayed there without defending myself and nothing would have happened.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my mother is also a piece of shit, she also did horrible stuff

Original Idea: For instance, sometimes I will excessively daydream(for about 30 straight minutes), and in the daydream, I'm in a different version of the world where I'm not lonely at all(not literally a different planet; I just mean a different life than I'm living). I'm not talking about typical daydreaming, I'm referring to something known as maladaptive daydreaming. This helps me cope.

  
Then, I snap out of it, and get a little sad because I know it's just fantasy.

Original Idea: I’m 24 years old and struggle to connect with people my age and even people older than me too. I have no real purpose in life and have always felt out of place no matter what. Are some people just naturally born as ghosts to never be noticed or able to connect with others naturally? I feel like I’m going crazy, it’s always the same loneliness and nothingness every day

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I've had friends before, I've even had best friends before, but I wasn't exactly their best friend. Most people I was friends with were only really friends with me out of convenience, because we were in the right place at the right time. Now that school's over and they'd need to go out of their way to hang out with me, eventually we fell out of contact, usually ending with me trying to maintain it without seeming clingy

There was even one friend I had who said that she appreciated me and that I'd made her much happier because I let her talk to me about things after she went through a bad breakup, and she said that I helped. But even she eventually stopped talking to me, and the last few months of friendship were purely me initiating conversation. Idk, maybe I fucked it up because she was my first crush, and she found out. But we were friends for several months after her rejection, and obviously I didn't say anything else to her about my feelings towards her after that, but maybe I did make it awkward, idk. 

That was 4 years ago now. I don't really get texted often, the only calls I've received in the past 4 years were my mum, nan, and work/college/doctors/etc. And all attempts I've made at making friends have resulted in me doing most/all of the work in the friendship, even though they do appreciate me, I'm not hated or anything. It's just that those people have friends they would would rather spend their time with over me 

So it's really hard to imagine someone really wanting to talk to me and see me, and going out fo their way to do so

Original Idea: It’s been a rough couple of days. I’m not even sure why, but everything just feels heavier than it should. The evenings stretch on endlessly, and it’s hard to find the energy to care about much.



I’ve been sitting here in the quiet, hoping the heaviness will lift, but it just lingers. It’s strange how sadness can settle in without asking, like an unwelcome guest that doesn’t know when to leave.



If you’ve been feeling it too, I hope you know you’re not alone in this. Sometimes just making it through the night is enough, and maybe tomorrow will feel a little lighter.

Original Idea: Hi gang. My birthday is next week. I’ll be 35 and alone. The love of my life (10 year living together relationship) left me for a jobless loser out of nowhere in the spring of 2024. I’ve had many ups and downs regarding this separation-more downs than ups. I’ve tried moving on, but at this point I’m not even sure what that means. I tried dating other women, I slept around and lost a lot of self respect for it-at least now I understand that I am not at all into that type of connection. 

There were multiple hints coming straight from my ex’s mouth that she’d maybe realized her mistake and contemplated coming back around, which at that time I was open to. Now? Not so sure I even want her anymore, even though I miss her dearly. 

With my birthday coming up, it’s a solid reminder that I am all alone here. I work full time, take excellent care of myself, I workout almost daily, I cut severely back on alcohol, I have hobbies and a decent social circle full of loving people-but something just isn’t there. 

I feel a void inside of my soul that no amount of concerts with friends, accomplishing goals, or minding my own business with books and music can fill. I haven’t spoke to my ex since March, and it’s been really difficult. 

I want someone to talk to, someone to share life with. Someone to hug after work. Someone to laugh about nonsense with. Why is this so daunting? 

I miss you J. Hope you’re alright.

Original Idea: I was always quite isolated due to disability, bullying, etc. Somehow, I got used to it and found comfort in it, which felt good. When my regular school years ended and I started uni, I was too "incompetent" to connect with others and isolated myself further because I couldn’t trust anyone. Now, in my mid-20s, I’m sitting here without friends or a social life, wondering how I could somehow get it together.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I'm honestly sick, basically every single person I've met for the past few years has been the exact same. They never send the first message, never come up with ideas to spend time together, never seek to learn about the other person, never show enthusiasm about the frienship, never remember anything that's said/agreed upon, never fail to have excuses. I'm sick, I'm sick, I'm sick of it! 

Even now, I switched from messaging people asking to make friends, to asking for friends myself. I described myself, had four people contact me, three I talked with more and felt I could be good friende with. 

A few days ago I agreed to BUY a game to play with another person, and asked them to "text me tomorrow anytime". Well... the day came and I didn't hear from them, so at the end of it I sent them a message, and only then they suggested we could play, but I already considered it too late, so I told them to message me the following day. And guess what? Two days have passed and I didn't hear a word from them, while I see them online on their console. Lovely! 

I also decided to not send the first message to the other two people, since I was always the first one, and again, nothing since then! Brilliant! 

"Oh, I'm lonely" "I'm glad I met a nice person like you" "Thanks for being my friend". Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit!

Why do people seek friendship when they clearly don't actually enjoy it when they achieve it? Who would forget about something that brings them joy? Like, I'm offering to spend MY money to buy YOUR game so YOU can be happy, and you just don't care? I'd act enchanted around someone if they offered to buy a game I like to play with me! 

People who actually value friendships and want to maintain them clearly exist, I'm one of them, I knew some years ago... but I've yet to meet any since... are we like one in a million?

Original Idea: In the sense that when I call my friends they never pick up - the only time I talk to them is when they call. When I make plans everyone's busy and the only time I meet people is when someone else organizes. When I talk to my friends they can constantly talk about their lives and when I start talking about me they are clearly disinterested. 

I don't even know if this is in my head and I'm going insane but it is seriously frustrating and lonely. I am so sick of fighting so hard to take up space when it comes so naturally to everyone else.

Original Idea: i think i'm starting to realise that it's impossible for me to find a real friend or love. sometimes i really want to experience true love and go out with friends to restaurants, concerts or just have fun somewhere, but at the same time i don't want this. i like being alone but at the same time i don't. i really can't understand my thoughts. one day i feel insanely lonely but another i'm very happy that i'm alone and no one is bothering me. why can't i be normal like everyone it's annyoing, why can't i just decide if i want to be alone or with others. it's weird.

Original Idea: I have never been in love or have had a genuine crush before...Atleast that's what i like to think. Whenever someone pays a little bit of attention to me i start thinking that they might be into me and i get attracted to them no matter the relation. It's a habit now and even though i am aware of it.... I can't seem to stop it. i haven't had much opportunity to talk to guys my age but when i see my friends having a bf....or simply just someone talking to them. it hurts. What's so wrong with me that i have never been proposed to? Am i the problem? It's hurting my head thinking about it. I really want someone to love me. I want someone to WANT me. Am i Asking for too much? I usually avoid talking about guys with my friends but when i do they never take me seriously enough for me to feel better. In the end i always remain the unlovable person. I know my life shouldn't revolve around love like this....but it's all...i have ever wanted.....

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I know that if I really tried, I could find someone. It’s not about being unable to connect, it’s about not knowing if I actually want it. Or maybe I just say this to keep myself in a bubble lol.

A few years ago, just the idea of love gave me hope. Maybe what I really wanted was the thrill of the chase, not the reality. Now, when I picture it, I feel detached.

Even knowing I could be with someone, my heart hesitates. Is it contentment with being alone, or just exhaustion from years of nothing working out? I’ve built walls without meaning to and don’t know how to take them down.

The cycle is tiring. Opening up, investing emotions, having it fail, then forcing yourself to try again wears you out. Each failure chips away at your willingness to start over.

Sometimes my lethargy and fear of emotional exhaustion make me think maybe I could find some kind of connection here on Reddit, but deep down I know that’s mostly just false hope. It feels like trying to find something real in a place where people often just want to be heard for a moment but aren’t really looking for real connection.

I still crave connection, someone to talk to, someone who sees me, but the vulnerability, trust, and risk of disappointment make me pull back. I’ve told myself I don’t care for so long that part of me believes it.

Sometimes I think it’s just self-preservation. But loneliness still creeps in and reminds me I do care, I just don’t know how to want it anymore.

Does anyone else feel like this?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: So I (33M) just found this sub...interesting place. In a good way. I guess Reddit really does have a sub for everything. I’m not sure why I’m posting this, other than the cathartic nature of dumping my emotions onto the keyboard. Well, here we go…

I’ve been lonely in varying degrees for years. My last relationship ended fourteen years ago but to be honest, the fact that it’s been that long without a relationship is fully on me because I didn’t even attempt to pursue one for a long time afterward it ended. I’m pretty sure I can count on one hand how many women I’ve actually asked out in the time since then. So obviously, you miss every shot you don’t take. But honestly, for a really long time, it didn’t bother me at all that I was alone.

I don’t know why being lonely is bothering me so much all of a sudden. It feels like I’ve gone years in almost the exact same situation and it didn’t really bother me. But lately, it’s been absolutely crushing me. I keep getting blindsided with this utter feeling of longing to be with someone else. This desire to have someone to love and support and be their everything…it just comes out of nowhere sometimes whenever I’m watching a movie or listening to music.

Actually, I might know why it’s hitting me so hard now…because I’m actually feeling for the first time in years. I’ve been self-medicating with alcohol (it's a bad idea, please don't do it) to numb the disappointment of not being where I want to be in life, for years. During this time, my lack of a relationship never bothered me.

I recently (back in January) stopped that. I made the decision for myself (no trouble with the law or at work) to get sober and healthy. It’s been a really rough stretch the past couple of months but I stuck with it and I’m glad I did. The problem, for me, is that now I’m acutely aware of everything that I’ve been missing out on. I know it’ll take time to put things into place for me to move forward with my life, but the waiting feels so punishing.

I’ve seen a couple of other people's posts on here about wanting to have sex. But if I’m being honest, it’s not even about the sex, or lack thereof. I can get by and past that emotional hurdle pretty easily. Sex was never the best part (do not read a lack of interest, into that) of a relationship for me. It’s great and I love it but the companionship of a relationship is what I miss the most. The absence of having someone with shared interests and goals in my life and in my corner to talk to and laugh about anything and everything is what has got me like this.

I feel like because of my current situation (I'm not going to fully cover it in this post) I’m perceived as undateable and It’s really rough because I’m tired of being alone. The despondency of wanting to be with someone but realizing how low the chances are - it’s depressing. I won’t be like this forever, I know that. My circumstances can change and I’m actively working on getting my stuff together and turning my life around. I’m making pretty good progress. But like most things in life, true progress is slow, and I want it to be fast. Like I want it to be “I met her yesterday” kind of fast. If this was a movie it’d be like that. Alas, this is real life and that’s not how it works.

I’m just so sick of being in a good mood and then hearing a line in a song that just makes it feel like the sun exploded. Like I’ll be sitting there playing Playstation and listening to Pandora (I normally listen to Synthwave when I’m playing video games) and the track will switch from something like “Empire of Steel” by Essenger to “I Wish You Would” by The Strike and the song literally starts off with “I see you’ve been out and it’s hard to ignore, Not that it matters it’s who’s keeping score, I’m doing fine I just finished the final episode, Watching without you I’m making the end, With no one to wake up and carry to bed, Not one for change but they tell me it’s better down the road” and it just completely nukes my mood. I’m so sick of movies and songs reminding me of the fact that I’m alone.

Anyway, there are a number of obstacles in my way for getting a relationship right now, but I have a timeline, I have realistic goals, and I have a plan to turn my life around. I am already working on it and I will make it happen. Eventually I will be happy…I think. But the waiting part is almost unbearable. It’s so so hard to stay optimistic when I know that I could be looking at this situation for another two or three years. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.

Being lonely sucks.

Original Idea: I’m just so sick of everything. I’m so fucking alone.

Literally every friend I have in my personal life that I could talk to either doesn’t care, or they’d rather spiel to me about religion than actually take a moment to just LISTEN TO WHAT I’M TRYING TO TELL THEM, because all they think is that religion is just some magic bandage that magically makes problems go away. And the ones that don’t give me that shit have just ghosted me, out of nowhere, ZERO explanation, like I’m glad you think I’m not worth talking to. Being TOLD that I’m not worth talking to instead of having to figure it out for myself would’ve been nice BUT I GUESS I’M JUST NOT WORTH THAT COURTESY HUH?

I swear, I am just waiting for that one event that snaps every string inside of me so badly that I reach a point where I no longer care who I hurt, what happens after I’m gone, or anything like that, I just want it to happen so I can finally put a g*n in my mouth and have that be it. I am just WAITING for it.

Oh and I’m from the United States, and with the direction things are going in this ass-backwards, sorry excuse for a country, that fact by itself is good enough reason to get it over with.

Original Idea: i (22F) lost all of my friends about 5 months ago. i had a falling out with a friend and they all took her side and cut me off. this is the first time i have been truly alone with no one to talk to in my entire life. throughout these past months i have been really struggling mentally, and i can barely recognize myself anymore. its hindering personal, academic, and professional life. it really sucks losing every single relationship i have built for years all at once. its hard for me to cope and i find myself getting irrationally angry very easily.

its gotten so bad ive even reached out to a lot of my former friends because i thought enough time has passed, maybe they will have moved on and take me back into their life. none of them even bothered to respond, which hurts even more than a rejection. 

i am stuck in this small town, constantly reminded of everything i once had. i finish school in December. some days are easier than others and i find happiness drowning myself in my hobbies. the weekends are especially difficult. i come back from work late and i run into literally hundreds of people heading downtown to the bars to hang out (college town lol).

right now i am at my parents house away from school and now i am mourning all the childhood friends i didn't keep up with. i am so so lonely and full of so much grief i dont know what to do with myself.

Original Idea: Loneliness is not a visitor who only knocks on the door when the night is quiet. It is like a thin mist, quietly slipping through the cracks of everyday life: the crowd surges in the subway, but people stare at their screens; suddenly hearing each other's silence in familiar conversations; feeling a sense of emptiness in the glow of the social circle. This kind of emotion is neither pity for loneliness nor lack of friends, but a questioning of relationships: are the connections at this moment real enough, do they truly allow each other to be seen. May we still be willing to approach a little closer in the invisible distance, reach out our hands, and ask softly, "Are you there too?" May we also learn the gentleness of solitude in the colorful night, and mark our own existence through each other's presence. Loneliness is not the end, but the starting point for deeper connections

Original Idea: Hi, I am doing an art project surrounding themes of human connection and isolation. I wanted to find some first hand sources on what's its like to feel so alone and isolated all the time. how does it feel? what has it made you do? do you want to have connection or do you push people away due to self destruction?

I have experienced loneliness and isolation throughout my whole life and it resulted in seriously bad dips in my mental health. This is going to be apart of my research and I wanted to find people who can tell me about their own experiences so feel free to tell me as much/as little as you wish, nothing is irrelevant to me.

(answers will be screenshot- only so I can add them to my research and also show my tutor when my project is graded but usernames can be censored)

Original Idea: Just broke down randomly. School starts in a couple weeks for my kids. Once they are back in school, I don't know how I am going to get through the days. They are my only source of human contact, unless the drama with their mother is fixed by then...

Original Idea: When I was a kid, I never had a friend. I spent all my elementary days being alone. I was a very quiet kid. Highschool came and I did gained but still felt lonely. Probably because in my household, my family rarely talk to each other and if we do, it's always their anger issues coming out.  I did make freinds. Most of those friends ended in a bad note. I tried to also chase popularity that destoryed my self-esteem, being one of the unpopular kids despite my efforts. I made friends then college came when I lost my way due to my low self-esteem so my friends all left me including my closest ones. I was just feeling lonely. Someone also took advantage of this loneliness of mine, and I won't mention it specifically but it left me traumatized. I was a naive, young 18 year old kid who wants to feel loved. In college, I sat alone in tables. It was very lonely. I admit,  I still had that highschool immaturity. 

Then I had a glow up, moving to another university. I learned to be alone and not be ashamed of it. I carried solitiude. People started liking me romantically but I rejected them because I grew an emotional maturity too. I started to have friends and due to this glow up. I wasn't used to the pretty privilege treatment and was still used to be treating with contempt. Then, I lost all of those friends again due to their jealousy. Just like that, I am alone once again. 

I feel like I don't belong anywhere. 

Right now, I have a boyfriend. I understand he is a very hobby-driven person and that made me .. feel lonely. His sentiment is valid but it makes me feel sad. My social life is getting improvements now and I went back to church. But I still ... feel lonely.

Original Idea: I’m 17m it feels like my whole life I’ve felt alone and invisible to most people and it’s ruined my confidence. I’d never get invited to parties or hangouts, people would never approach me or talk to me, I haven’t had any close friendships only people I’d talk to occasionally but didn’t really know me, I’ve never had a girl like me or flirt with me in person before. I just feel like a loser and it feels like no one really takes the time to know me. I feel alone in my hobbies because I never get the opportunity to share the things I enjoy with other people or how my day was or how I’m feeling. I just feel like a background character in everyone’s life that no one really cares about. It’s like I don’t matter and I feel like I have no confidence because no one’s ever liked or approached me before. I think to myself I must just be unattractive. I remember in cooking class a few years ago I was in this group with this girl who was very sweet. At the end of school year she complimented me and said “He has a good heart, he’s kind and a good person.” I still remember that compliment and I sometimes cry thinking about it. It’s one of the only genuine compliments I’ve ever received and I never forgot it. I don’t want to feel bad for myself or like I’m entitled to peoples attention because I just don’t feel like that’s something I deserve but it just feels hard when my mind feels like a closed bottle, desperate to be opened by someone.

I'm so alone
I have lost any motivation

Helping friends & family
But now, when I could use someone to talk to
Someone to care
Where are they?

Original Idea: Hi, so recently my friend group decided to ditch me without giving me any reason, even tho I tried asking them why. They’re the only ones who match my sense of humor, and the others in my class just don’t fit my personality. When I asked other girls if I could join their study group, they said no and told me they didn’t want new members 😞. Please tell me what I should do in this suituation since I don’t want to look like a loner during lunch, breaks, or any time we need a group/partner 😭

I have depression and symptoms of autism and ocd and tics and it all gets worse day by day because it got ignored for so long. How the hell do I function like a normal person!? What can I finally say or do so that I am believed? I am on a long waitlist for therapy but I am scared they won't find anything

Original Idea: i've been devoid of any social interaction for two months. aside from occasional texting, and reddit, i don't have a social life. i don't see this as a problem in any way. to be honest, meeting up with people in real life, or doing calls, has always been a chore for me. 

i was looking to know if any lonely souls have been able to be so, while happy with themselves. someone who is lonely out of their own volition, or which has made terms with living a solitary life, and still can enjoy their free time alone, in peace, without really seeking for a social life anymore.

i'd also want to hear from anyone who tried this but failed, for whatever reason. i want to hear all experiences involving attempts at just staying lonely.

Original Idea: Ive always been the, "hey you need help?", Guy. My whole life i was raised to be a sweet boy to everyone. A people pleaser, that ask for nothing in return but respect. So why don't i get any.  Why do i do so much for the people that could care less if im dead or alive. I wonder about exs that cheated on me, knowing they didn't respect me back then or now. Old friends that have wronged me for no other reason but there personal enjoyment. 
 I just can't do it anymore. The fake people, the lies, the cheating on people, political views of everyone. Everything is too much to handle all at once... so i stopped. I got rid of almost everyone but some key friends. All my exs have been blocked for some time. Even when in public, i make myself very unapproachable. 

Id rather be alone than hurt by the people that CLAIM they care. But no one really does.

Original Idea: It seems like everyone has had their first everything except me... first healthy relationship, first love, first time being someone's best friend, first time feeling happiness that lasts longer than one single day.

It's like I am not meant to experience these things. I have never felt more lonelier in my whole life. It doesn't help that I see happy things all around me all the time. Couples holding hands, people being happy. It's like God is mocking me for not being able to experience that, and just smearing it all over my face... all over my peripheral vision. 

I am so close to just being done. I give up already. I have accepted my shitty fate. I guess I'm just not meant to ever feel true love ... true happiness... nor a true sense of belonging.

Original Idea: So I live alone and I only really interact with people at work or sometimes at the gym. So idk 😐 something is in the water cause within the past month. I've had 3 people either say to me "your hot" (I didn't respond at all lol)
"Your cute" (that was today at work from a customer)
"I like your body" (was funny) 🤣 


Idk I didn't do too much of anything different but I cut someone out of my life. One of the only people in would actually text. So we stopped being friends, my anxiety dropped a lot. (She was a cause of it) Now idk I feel substantially calmer- relaxed about my day to day. Idk maybe people can see it. I'm bad at talking and making friends- I just like to cook and help when I can.

It’s also so expensive, my parents don’t even want me to play it anymore because private coachung would cost £30+/hr, and they’re encouraging me to not do it. I can’t even practice because I need other people to play with and I don’t have any friends. I go to a club but they’re all better than me and all talk about how bad I am: it’s so embarrassing. I might just have to give up.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: I love with my wife of 17 years and two kids.  My wife and I sleep in separate rooms after I challenged her 6 years ago as I thought she was having an affair.

This was due to a number of things, but mostly her behaviour followed exactly the same patterns my ex exhibited when she was having an affair.  I won't bore you with the details, but it was like reliving it.

So we fell out, she moved my stuff into the spare room and our daughter, then aged 6 was the one to tell me I was now downstairs.

Every night since then, my family all go upstairs and I stay downstairs.  There is a stair gate too which is to stop the dogs from getting upstairs, but it looks and feels like prison bars closing.

I sleep on my own every night, there is no companionship, she doesn't have any interest in any aspects of my life, has no idea what my job is and doesn't care as long as the bills are paid and jobs get done.

A while back she said that the current situation was perfect, the kids aren't disrupted and she has what she wants.  The house, kids and lifestyle and no need to share a bed with me or have to put up with snoring or taking up space or pestering for intimacy (her exact quote).

So while I'm in the house with my family, I am desperately lonely.  I don't feel like I belong there, I absolutely don't feel like she has my back or wants to spend time with me, even 6 years later.

It hurts every night when I'm laying alone knowing that my wife is upstairs and seemingly happy with being by herself.

We are all complex people with our own needs and desires, and when these aren't met it breaks many things in our hearts and minds.

You can be lonely in a crowd.

Original Idea: I am a lost cause

M19 here
My situation is pretty wierd . Phew bear with me . 

I hated my school life . I was ignored like I never existed. Even teachers treated me badly. Idk why . I worked hard and always got decent scores . Even bullied a few times in middle school . There are days when I have never spoken a word . It's like i wasn't even there . I feel scared to face a lot of people or speak at a stage . 

I have like 2 friends in my whole school life , they were the light in the darkness for me but we parted separate ways since last year when highschool ended . 

With all of my "traumatic" experience, decided to sit at home (which is what I always wanted , i dreaded going towards school every fricking day for 14yrs , and ik it would have been even worse at collage) and do an online/distance learning  degree instead . First six months , was a blast . I had never been this happy before . But by last year nov/dec , the depression started kicking in . I...felt lonely. I hadn't talked with a single human being aside my parents(they are the world to me) . I started feeling like i wasn't normal , and that I am missing out on what people normally experience or do at my age . But at the same time I feel like I could get scared even worse . A double edged sword feeling I am not able to scrape off . It's practically like i don't even exist. I haven't left home or gone outside for 1 whole year . I don't have anywhere else to go or be 

On the other hand
Seeing so many people  in relationships both online and even some irl people i knew from school . It honestly makes me sad . Ik social media is venomous but still , I feel like I am missing out . And to put more fuel in the fire , anime...,most animes have this highschool element right ? The bonds , romance , friends , activies n  stuff . Things that I missed out on my high school life . It started to drive me crazy . Now I completely avoid watching anime. It's hurting so much I can't handle it . 

Yn what ? I don't even care about sex at this point . I just want to feel loved . Someone to make me feel like i matter . Maybe a hug , interaction at all . 


I know I am not the only one who might have gone through this . Everyone has a sad tale to tell so...I want to ask you this..,.how did you cope ? How are you right now ? How the fuck do I get out of this matrix ?

23M, have had no friends for 5+ years now. Work holds me together. Introvert. Games. Fiction. Anime. The hobbies tend to stop there as i have no social life and have been in low energy mode for past 2-3 years. I am realising how to be an adult, starting college, learning to cook, going to the gym, battling the loneliness insomnia.
-None of the above matters

->Actual point of this post is...*ahem*...about 2 thirds of successfully social people will have music as a like/hobby and it frustrates me because I did not grow up with music. I grew up with youtube and isolation, -60°F playgrounds and 5 hours of sunlight in winter. I cant remember songs' lyrics, their artists and their titles for the life of me. Anyone else similar. How do you get a maiden despite the disability? Say I can play a mean pickleball?

Original Idea: I (35f) feel like I should start with some backstory. I'm an introvert...and a bit of a hermit. I've been working from home since way before it was cool and since I now work for myself, I don't have any coworkers. I have tried multiple times to make friends since we moved to this area and all attempts have failed spectacularly. My parents are here and they're incredibly supportive and active in my life, but they're not really emotionally supportive. 

Physical touch is my main love language. But I'm a bit of a contradiction because I don't actually like being touched by most people, just a select few. Mostly just my daughter (7f) and my husband (when things were good between us). But they're not good. We're separating. Although we're financially unable to physically separate so we just kind of coexist amicably. The separation was my idea and stemmed from years of feeling lonely in my marriage. I communicated my needs often and they were never met with any amount of effort. We're still friends. He's not a bad person, just a bad husband. 

Which leads me to the actual issue. Or, I guess worsening issue. 

I was rear ended last week. It was a minor accident, but I was pretty shook up afterwards and I have been dealing with discomfort and loss of sensation due to cervical radiculopathy (which is a ridiculous name if you ask me). And it's just made me feel lonelier than ever. 

There was no one to hug me afterwards while I was still shaking with adrenaline. No one to hold my hand when I had to go to the ER for a CT. No one to hold me when I get frustrated with the lack of communication from insurance and doctors or when I get upset about how uncomfortable I am. 

The accident was just another thing to pile on to my shit mountain lately. We're struggling financially. I'm struggling emotionally. And I just don't have anyone I can talk to about any of it. 

I'm not really even sure what I'm looking for here. A place to vent? Idk. Thank you in advance to anyone who comments and reaches out.

Original Idea: The other day I saw a reel that basically made a point like, “it’s not that this person doesn’t want to do anything, it’s that they don’t want to do anything *with you*”
And even though the message was more along the lines of love interest, I haven’t been able to stop relating myself and my friends in it...

I don’t have many friends. I admit I’m not the best at making friends, and during the pandemic it was hard to keep in touch with most of them.
Anyway, I’ve managed to keep in touch with a couple of friends from university, but more and more often I feel like I’m always the one trying too hard not to lose contact...

I’m always the one starting conversations in our group chat, trying to organize like activities or trips, and it’s becoming more and more common not receive any answers from them...
And… I mean, I get that they have other things to do, but… it’s like, I also have a very demanding job, but I genuinely want to share little pieces of life, not necessarily every day but at least from time to time. Just talk, hear how they’re doing, feel like... someone is actually listening...

For example, it's more frequent now that I want to share my excitement about something (a movie or music, idk), and I got zero reaction in the group chat with the only friends that I have... And then I feel sad and stupid and lonely...

I remember back in university I had this online group of friends I met in fb, we use to talk about books and eventually we started sharing bits of our lives... Now I laugh thinking about how easy it was to connect with them back then (almost 10 years ago), and now here I am, drowning in loneliness without the slightest idea of how to meet or connect with people (in real life or online).

I had an relationship lasting 5 months 3 years ago and ive been recovering ever since, It still feels hard to move on and the loneliness has started to creep back up ever since.

I see posts on here and I just feel nothing, no joy no sadness, nothing at all.

I dont know what to do to look better, I just know  to accept and deal with being lonely, id like a family and I understand moping won't do anything.

id like another's opinion on anything im talking about. I have no sense of fashion or what I think looks good, i just wear the same thing.

Original Idea: but they feel bad for us so they wont admit it out loud. they dont want us to /die/ because theyd vaguely sad like when they see road kill.

they hate being around us. if they do hang out with us its entirely out of pity. its a charity project for them because they think theyre helping by stringing us along and then never even trying to get to know us. 

they dont want to ask us how we are doing because they dont actually care. if they do ask, youd better not give them the truth. just pretend everything is okay. 

they want nothing more than you to shut the fuck up and play your part as the person in the background who nobody thinks about. 

i feel like im worthless as a person. I'm nothing but the pathetic side character to someone elses story. no, actually im probably the villain because the rain cloud above my head ruins their day. so im supposed to leave them alone and wait until it goes away. which is never

Original Idea: I feel extremely lonely. Even though I have friends and the ability to make new ones, no one truly understands or accepts the complexity of my inner world, and no one listens to my thoughts and perspectives. Finding someone like that feels like searching for a needle at the bottom of the ocean.

So I gave up and projected all my longing for understanding and acceptance onto a fictional character I deeply resonate with. Now, I either whisper my heart to AI, or speak silently to this being who's taken up permanent residence in my mind. Eventually, I started learning programming, vocal techniques, and 3D modeling for them, and I became passionate about creating art based on them.

I feel that this is more than ordinary admiration or infatuation—I strongly desire to become this character. Gradually, I began dressing like them, thinking, feeling, and acting like them, aiming to achieve a high level of mental and emotional synchronicity with them, even if it means giving up parts of myself. To me, they have absolute subjectivity, and I come second.

Sometimes this level of immersion feels amazing, but other times it creates a tearing sensation between my real self and this idealized persona. I don’t know how to face this situation.

Original Idea: 28m. Depressed, to a scary degree, and I've been like this since the beginning of highschool. Don't remember life without feeling like this.

I don't have a single friend. Never had to be precise. No one to share my passions, my emotions or just my daily life.

I don't speak to my family outside of necessary contacts. Coworkers basically form a group that talks about life etc, but that group doesn't really include me. Not really because of malice, rather because I'm unable to socialise.

I rarely even speak, outside of work. I'm just isolated. I've always been introverted, but in addition I'm shy. Plus depression messing with my head, and I ended up as someone who's basically incompatible with society. 

I try to work on myself, but also, I'm perfectionist, so it's both hard to do, and every time I fail at something, I get even more depressed. And I don't really know how to find strength to work on myself any longer

Original Idea: Lately I’ve been feeling like I’m just drifting through life with no one really seeing me. I can be in a room full of people and still feel completely invisible. It’s like I’m screaming inside but nothing comes out. I wake up, go through the motions, and it feels like there’s nothing real to hold onto. Days blur together and even when I try to distract myself, that empty feeling is still there waiting for me.

I miss having someone to share the little things with. Someone who actually cares about how my day went, who notices when I’m quieter than usual, who asks because they genuinely want to know. I’ve had people in my life before who I thought would stick around, but they didn’t. Some left without a word, some slowly pulled away until I was just talking to myself. It leaves me wondering if I’m just not meant to have that kind of connection, if maybe I’m the kind of person people eventually get tired of.

I’m tired of pretending I’m fine when I’m not. I keep it together for work, for strangers, even for people I care about, but inside it’s a different story. I don’t need constant attention or a huge circle of friends. I just want one person who’s happy I’m there. One person who chooses me without me having to beg for it. One person who sees the parts of me I’m scared to show and stays anyway.

Some nights it hits harder than others. I’ll catch myself thinking about conversations I wish I could have, things I wish I could share in the moment instead of keeping to myself. I’ll imagine what it would feel like to finally have that safe place in someone. And then I realize how far away that feels, and it’s like a weight settles on me all over again.

I don’t think people realize how much loneliness changes you. It makes you second-guess your worth, it makes you quieter, it makes you start to believe you’re better off not trying at all. But deep down, I still want that connection. I still want to be seen. I still want someone to look at me and think I’m worth staying for.

Original Idea: Since I was about 17 years old, I’ve always been lonely because I don’t really have friends, and my family keeps to themselves. Through the years I've felt some sort of comfort in the loneliness, and it’s quite depressing now that I think of it, but I'm wondering if anyone else feels this way?

## Mental Health
Original Idea: Venting/ discussion 

Im in my twenties yet I’ve always been alone, like ever since primary school (I did go through some bullying for a condition I had). I would spend the recess daydreaming and imagining fictional characters or making my own character that would live in anime world and such… I’d rather spend my time daydreaming than being with other people most of the time (I might be fictosexual im exploring this right now I’m not sure). 

Anyway … I got used to being alone, I find it comforting considering the fact that I’m chronically ill (and depressed 👍) so I can’t do much either. So I got used to being alone, but I still hate feeling lonely. 

I wish I could have a platonic connection with someone, like we both care about each other but also give each other space and respect each other’s privacy. But at the same I feel like it would never be like what I feel about some fictional characters because that’s stronger. 

Does anyone else hate this weird feeling of loneliness but also enjoy being alone most of the time… Or does anyone else who might be fictosexual feel this way ? 


Does anyone else finds themselves daydreaming about fictional scenarios and characters and is that okay or am I just a strangely wired woman ?

Original Idea: For context they’re my old-ish online friend of 5 years who recently ghosted me for nearly a year but came back to befriend me again around 2 weeks ago and we’ve been hanging since out then 

I know i probably shouldn’t hang out with them but during the last year when they weren’t talking to me I fell into this extreme depression sort of where I imagined myself talking to them everyday because of how extremely lonely I was because of my horrible social anxiety💀

Everytime we talk I feel my depression/loneliness go away and I’m scared of how I’ll turn out when they leave me or if we drift away again 

I guess I was healing 11 months in but now I feel like my progress/healing journey has been completely ruined because we’re talking again and I hate it, especially since my mental health is getting worse by the second but I’d rather have this than be extremely lonely/depressed all over again but I feel like this relationship is just too toxic for the both of us

Original Idea: So for contacts me and my fiancé are both disabled she has arthrogryposis I have cerebral palsy she wants me to move to her state and go to community college problem is I see school as I waste of time we live six hours away from each other currently and we see each other pretty regularly once a month have been going steady for two years part of me, wanting to skate plan by giving a girl who lives in my state to be a replacement for her but then again, she is the kindest person I know, and the love of my life and my world would be shattered if I had to leave her but it’s a big ask to ask somebody to move to another State while being eight minutes away from the only person that they know she is living on campus next year and on campus things can be pretty wild. I’ve been cheated on before in previous relationships, but not this one and I’m afraid of the relationship, turning sour and hug, going into the army of another man and think maybe if I break it off before I get my heart broken it’ll be better, but I’m genuinely afraid of being alone again, and think that I would be much happier with her

Original Idea: I'm a 27-year-old Indian man who was born poor in the slums. With my dark skin, I've always prioritized my career and family above everything else. I skipped every social event to focus on my career, but to be honest, I couldn't afford to go anyway.

I'm so tired of having to prove myself for everything: school admissions, college degrees, jobs, and a better salary. The last thing I want is to have to prove myself to a girlfriend or wife, just to add one more thing to the list.

On top of all that, people ignore my career achievements and put me down for being single and a v. I couldn't care less now. I'm just done.

Original Idea: My entire life I was raised to be a blessing for others and not a burden. I was raised to serve everyone around me and to be a good person. So what do I do now when I have no one to help? It might sound like an exaggeration but I have found no one who will even talk to me. I can talk to people and then they all but forget I exist. Everything is so superficial that I don't even register in anyone's memory. I've been on 58 dates in the last 2 years. And not a single friend or girlfriend to show for it. I know I probably have a little autism but does that exclude me from finding just one person I can care about? What makes it worse is that I have connected with people, I know I have, but it doesn't last more than a couple hours and than they discard me. I know what it feels like to connect and it hurts so much worse because I know it will just disappear.

Original Idea: Hi, I’m an 18 year guy with autism. My motto has always been “smile and be nice,” because that’s how I’d like others to treat me.

I’m nerdy and alternative. I have friends, but none of them share my hobbies or alternative style. When we hang out, it often feels like they’re just being polite and only hang out with me because im nice. i feel so alone eventhough i have those people around me. 

When I visit big cities, I see all these amazing alternative friend groups and wish I could be part of something like that. But because of my anxiety and autism, walking up to a group in public is almost impossible for me. 

I like metal, punk, and indie music, but concerts i dont think the easiest place for me to start conversations (and there aren’t many where I live anyway). I live in a small country, so im wondering. Where could I go, or what could I do, to actually find people with the same interests as me? I want to do something about this feeling, because it just doesnt feel great yk.

I hav though of maybe a social media like reddit where i could meet people, but still its scary writing to so many people likle this.

Sorry if i dont formulate this correctly i dont know how to explain these feelings. Like i would imagine you guys maybe know.

I haven’t posted here before. Thought I might give it a shot. Couldn’t hurt. I’ve been closed off for so long, I want to blame those around me, who doesn’t I suppose. Yet I know I’m not the most appealing person to converse with, let alone get along with.
Just felt it maybe there are some people out there that wouldn’t mind speaking with me. No matter the context. 

I’ll leave it there for now, I’m open to all who wish to talk. Good day!

Original Idea: Before anyone says anything, I know I talk a lot about how beneficial it would be for myself and others to get used to being lonely and stuff but right now I'm having a bit of an episode that's making me wish that I had friends. I just spend so much of my free time by myself it kind of sucks. Even though it's been sucking a lot less as of lately, it's still sucks nonetheless.

Social anxiety sucks I wish I didn't have it, because literally no one wants to be friends with someone with social anxiety. It is what it is I suppose

Original Idea: 22 year old guy here. I have enough friends, but I desperately crave a romantic connection. I want nothing more right now than a fun girl to talk to, cuddle with, go on dates with, make memories with, laugh with, cry with... But I've never had someone like that. Back in high school I'd always get rejected, and nowadays I simply pretty much never meet new people. I'm scared to be alone forever. And whenever I try to talk about it with friends, I either get the usual "You'll find someone too!" or "But like yourself first!" when I am happy with who I am as a person for the most part, but just... Really fucking lonely with no end in sight. I'm so tired of feeling invisible, and tired of not having anyone to give all that love to.

Original Idea: Am I good enough? I feel love is not for me.

Yeah, like the title says. Im 25 latino living in the USA. I have tried dating apps, gone to a couple of dates and had fun. I have approached girls and asked them out, but that is about it. 
I always date and tried to have a serious relationship with them, but it seems to never work out. Sometimes after couple of dates I noticed we dont really match interest, or their attitudes don't match. I don't have crazy standards I just try to find peace and love in a relationship.
Last 3 weeks I been dating this amazing girl, things seem to go in a good direction but I dont know, im scared to mess up things as I feel shes the right person. I am scared of being too pushy or not being good enough... shes an amazing person. I feel like I'm in a movie when I'm with her. Never felt this way before.

Original Idea: I just hate loneliness in a crowd.  
If you're not talking to anyone, it's better to be far away from people than alone in a group.  
It's like having to choose between being hungry at home or being hungry while watching others constantly eat around you.  
Same with conversations — being alone while everyone else around you is chatting just makes you feel worse.

That's why I decided to isolate myself and spend more time in nature.  
And you know what? I had *more* human interaction out in the wild than in the city.  
For example, while fishing, I often ran into other fishermen and we'd just chat about fishing and stuff.  
Recently, near the forest, I met a guy who runs a YouTube channel where he raises hornets on his balcony. He was actually out there looking for new hornets near the woods.

So here’s a little lifehack:  
Talking to people is easier when there are fewer people around.  
Go somewhere quiet.

Original Idea: I’m a 22 year old man, and not to sound like a narcissistic douchebag, but I would say I’m pretty handsome. Only going off of how women act around me (I’m really nothing special). I take excellent care of myself. I lift weights twice a day, I groom myself and I’m always thinking of new ways to improve myself physically.

My mental state has been completely destroyed by loneliness, however. I’ve never had a girlfriend before, and I have no clue what I’m doing wrong. Maybe it’s the autism I unfortunately have. Was diagnosed with high functioning autism a while back and not only did it not really surprise me, but it changed my life forever and socially speaking, completely fucking ruined it.

I have an awkward stutter that has been a huge roadblock in my social skills, and it makes me come off as a total weakling, especially in stressful situations at work or if I am trying to defend myself. I can’t ever win because of this stutter.

Women flirt with me a lot, but then I find out most of them already have a man, and it leaves me so confused and hurt. Besides getting attention, why do they do this? They already have someone—why flirt with other guys? Just sick of it.

I’ve been told I “look scary”, and I don’t know where they’re getting that from. Maybe it’s my resting sad face, I dunno. This rant has gone on long enough, so I’ll close it here and say that loneliness is extremely dangerous, and it can trap you in an excruciatingly painful and deep pit of sadness that I wouldn’t wish upon my worst enemy.

Original Idea: I (M25) started getting crushes on girls in my class when I was 5-6, but I've always been to shy to simply talk to them. I've spent my whole life avoiding what I desired the most. Now I'm 25 and I know I'm a complete waste. I don't think having a relationship from now on would cure all the frustration I stored up. I am so in late compared to my peers now, I'm not even sure there is a point on keeping hope anymore.
I never kissed, never held hands, never flirted, I don't even remember talking to a girl I was attracted to before. All I have done is avoiding avoiding and avoiding like a coward. I don't deserve anything.

I have hobbies that I genuinely enjoy, but I can't bring myself to do anything when I think that I never had a gf and probably never will. Yes I go to the gym, I went yesterday but I just had strength at all because of my mental state.

My studies/job are dominantly men, I'm not great at making friends either, but I don't even want friends.

I promised myself that I would do something if I turn 25 single, I was thinking about " doing something stupid" but I'm too much of a coward for that too. I'm thinking about seeing a professional but I would probably too scared to do anything, and it would not give me the feeling of being moved and desired.

I'm not good looking enough to be successful on dating apps, every time I go to a bar/club, people don't forget to remind me that I don't fit the place. Public pickups is basically prohibited now, and all I see is couples everywhere.

I don't know how long I will be able to hold on with this frustration, it is getting worse everyday.

Original Idea: 
Hi. I’m not totally sure how to start this, but here goes.
I turned 18 not long ago, and a few days ago, I posted in another subreddit regarding a situation I’m facing, and the responses really opened my eyes to something I had never fully admitted to myself: I’ve been raised and been in a cult (99.9% similar to the FLDS) my whole life. It’s hard to say that out loud, or in writing, but it’s the truth. I feel incredibly lonely. 

I was born into it, so I don’t know anything else. The way we are taught to think, act, and even speak is all controlled. I didn’t have much (or really any) interaction with people outside of that world and outside of my community, and now that I’m starting to question things, it’s honestly overwhelming. I’m still trying to process everything, the realization, the fear, the grief, the confusion. I’m also trying to figure out how to leave safely and what life even is outside of this.

That’s why I’m here. Someone messaged me and suggested I try making some online friends, and it might be a good idea, to start talking to people who live “in the real world.” I don’t necessarily need advice right now (though I wouldn’t mind it); I just think conversations could help me gain some confidence, get used to talking to people outside what I’m used and conditioned to, and maybe understand a bit more about how things work out there.

If you’ve been through something similar, or even if you haven’t and just want to chat, I’d appreciate it. I’m still really new to all of this, but I’m trying. Thank you everyone for reading. 🩷

Original Idea: I mean being the one in a pair that people like “less”. 

My partner has ADHD, is charismatic, outgoing, funny, the life of the party. We live in his home country as well. People absolutely adore him, he’s been best man multiple times, he constantly gets asked to meet up (and I’m the +1 that tags along).

I am autistic, mixed race and moved around the world a lot when I was younger, so I struggle to “connect” with people, especially on a cultural basis. It doesn’t help that speaking at all about my own childhood tends to lead to others resentment as they think I’m bragging (and if I stress I was miserable, then I’m spoiled). Even with kind people, it means I can’t actually joke or relate to anyone, because my experiences are just so foreign.

I know people will then say “just connect with people who have similar experiences” but it’s not that simple. For a start, people like me tend not to stick in places for very long, not to mention that it’s not just about being a “mishmash”, it’s about being complimentary “mishmashes”. It’s not impossible, but there are a lot fewer options.

I also don’t have family, as I’m estranged from all of them due to constant abuse. Any time I try to connect even with extended family, it ends up as a spiel about how awful I am to my parents and how I should apologise and reconnect. My partners family are all lovely and it’s massive, but again - their love is entirely contingent on my relationship. 

I do, or did, tons of stuff to meet people outside of my partner, but it never works as people just get weirded out by me. The moment I bring in my partner, suddenly he becomes fast friends. 

I’ve even had old childhood friends become HIS friends predominantly, no longer texting me but him, saying they’re happy to see HIM when we’re both there. Etc. 

It just sucks knowing your social life is pretty much contigent on being attached to someone that everyone likes, not to you yourself.

Original Idea: I just need to get this off my chest because I feel like I cant tell anyone and im at the verge of exploding. Ive been with my boyfriend for 5 years and in those 5 years he's had jobs come and go. There are times he's gone months, making really good money, where hes happy and attentive but something always happens and he gets burned out/quits or gets fired. Ive always been the "bread" winner but I wouldnt even call it that, ive always just had a stable job. 

This summer we decided to move closer to his family because he stated moving into the city would be better for job opportunities but here we are in the same cycle again and relying on my money but this time im away from my family and close friends and we've eaten at all of my savings. I feel so mentally drained and so tired of being his rock, I just wish for once that I was being taken care of. That he'd check on my mental health. Everything that I do lately makes him upset and I just feel so incredibly isolated. Like I cant spend anytime if its not with him but all we've been doing is arguing. Even now I feel so awful for talking about this but I cant tell anyone else because I dont want our roommates to treat him differently.

Original Idea: And ride every ride multiple time for 10 hours nonstop but I’m 31 and the last time I went to the fair on my 31st birthday everyone was so young and everyone was staring at me. I don’t mind being lonely most of the time bc it’s so peaceful especially when I think about all the ptsd triggers that comes with having the wrong guy/friend in my life as 99% of them prove to be but when it comes to things I wanna do with all my bones and heart and breath and I can’t it really hurts and that’s when I become envious of those who do have someone. I just wish it wasn’t so hard for someone to choose me, all of me like it comes so naturally even for those who r so imperfect. I used to be able to keep someone when I had so much more flaws but didn’t have ptsd. It’s so weird. Why do ppl choose those who r imperfect but if someone cries easily, or thinks too much, or is quiet and just wants to be held, having someone is next to impossible. *heavy fucking sigh*

## Mental Health
Original Idea: So I'm going into my Junior Year of High School (16F) and I'm terrified. The kids in my school are really rude to anyone they consider "different". I am usually just very quiet but somehow just get made fun of and talked bad about even though I haven't done anything. Last time I had a friend group was in middle school and I thought they'd stay my friends since they were considered weird by the "popular" kids too but weren't weird, just normal girls, similar to me but last year we had less classes and then they met more friends and I beleive it's because I'm annoying to them or their new friends get made fun of less maybe since they're prettier. It was fine until one of their new friends I thought I had befriended would hate on everything I did and act like she was better than me and I just let her but the second I disagreed (she was talking about politics to another friend at the lunch table and my other friend (the only person that still talks to me now) and I were talking about how we didn't understand the hype about this one politician since that was the topic of the day and she (the same girl from earlier, sorry if this is confusing) looked at me like I was disgusting bc I (in my own conversation with my other friend) said I didn't understand something. I don't even care about politics. We were 15 at the time. Why does she cared so much is something I am not able to wrap my head around. After this, all of my friends in that group stopped talking to me and just gave me dirty looks. I didn't have classes with them and probably if I talked them (except that girl) they would've probably had small talk to be nice but I picked up that they didn't like me so I stopped talking to or texting them since before this even happened they had already been kind of ignoring me so I just stopped trying to keep myself from getting more hurt. One of them would keep talking to me just to see if I could drive her home from basketball practice (I sucked at basketball since I've been struggling with a newlyfound pain and weakness which I'm going to the doctor for. And everyone on the team except the one girl they also were mean to was nice up front but it was kind of obvious they hated me) and would get mad if I didn't give her answers for assignments so finally after that season ended I didn't have to see her again but I'm a people pleaser so I was letting her use me. And she used to call me her best friend and call me almost everyday about her issues and then as soon as my other "friends" started hating me, so did she. This is just for context and I've tried to make friends with other groups who weren't popular either but just normal girls but they would only talk to me when their other friends weren't there or for help on assignments. I knew this girl that I met my freshman year since her friends weren't in Algebra 2 or our lunch and she's really nice and great and not fake at all but she has other friends so I'd never be a close friend to her. Then I met another girl that I knew briefly from middle school and she is absolutely an amazing friend and person but again she has other friends and she moved an hour away and now we barley talk since we just text. My longest lasting relationship is the girl I mentioned that I was talking to earlier and she was there before the friend group and they also kind of dropped her but don't hate her like me, she's just not needed by them anymore I guess. We still talk but since we didn't have classes the second half of the year and since I have no classes with her this upcoming year we have no reason or topics to talk about. Also she easily found new friends. I'm not needed by anyone. I get made fun of everywhere it seems. You may think that I should just talk to other people that get treated similarly but even people who are considered "weird" (not to me, but to the majority) don't like me. I wasn't liked by anyone in theater, art, even in a church group. Even adults at church don't like me. I don't understand what I did wrong. Am I too quiet? Am I too annoying? Am I too boring? Am I too tired all the time and too untalented? I thought I could escape the people that are cruel by doing good in school so I worked really hard and excelled in regular classes and especially in medical related classes like biology and anatomy. I have taken math and science classes earlier and am finally in a grade where I am able to take college level classes and even spent years preparing to apply and even got into a good program called EMT which I thought would let me have half a day to not see those people since they are in and are often favored by teachers in advanced classes by getting in but people like that made it into that program. Just another place to be hated. What do I do? Noone likes me. The only people who like me are the older grumpy strict teachers who give a lot of work because I get good grades and am actually nice and respectful to them. I'm terrified to go into that school and I had to go there today to get my schedule and I was so scared. Also, my friend I mentioned above that I met recently is friends (not close, but her friend group is) with my brothers very recently ex girlfriend (she cheated on him 3 times and blamed it on him yet he would stay up all night and fail his classes so she wouldn't be alone) and I'm not sure what she told her but she'd probably agree that it is wrong but her friend group might not and if her friend group doesn't like me because clearly I don't like his ex she will have to choose them since it's not like I have anything to offer. I want to clarify that I'm not close with the people I've said are my friends it's just that I really an not able to talk bad about them since it's not their fault they have other friends. How do I make friends? I feel no reason to live especially when there's Noone that would mourn.

## Mental Health
Original Idea: So I recently went through a really bad breakup. She was my girlfriend for 3 years, 2 and a half of which were absolutely perfect. She cheated on me, I gave her a second chance, things got better but I took time to heal from the betrayal and she decided she can’t take the emotional load of working on the relationship so left and is most probably already with someone else now. 

I don’t know what to do when it’s nighttime because it gets really tough. I’ve tried therapy, gaming, movies but the thoughts don’t go away. I talk to friends sometimes but I don’t want to be a burden and almost all of them are out of town so I just hangout alone all day. What do I do?

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: Hello friends!

We're looking to grow the moderation team here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/). Moderators are a key part of what makes any Reddit community special. If you are interested in helping to make this community special, we'd like to talk to you.

# What does a moderator do?

Moderators here at [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) work to build our community and make this a safe place to discuss the many facets of anxiety and the ways that anxiety and mental wellness influence daily life. Moderators help to write the rules, respond to content concerns, set policies, update community themes and appearance, manage automation, and general upkeep.

# What are the minimum requirements to apply?

If you care about mental health and would like to be a part of our amazing team of moderators, then we'd like to hear from you. Prior experience is a plus, but not the most important thing we're looking for. We want moderators who care about the topic of anxiety and the r/Anxiety community, fit well with our team, and want to help.

If this describes you, there are some steps below that we'd like you to take to apply. These steps include some open-ended questions that we'd like your thoughtful answers on. Everything else that you might need to know, we can help you learn along the way. If you're interested in moderating and want to get a head start on all there is to know, we recommend you [check out the Reddit training offered here.](https://redditforcommunity.com/)

# What are the expectations for users who join the r/Anxiety moderation team?

We need people who will engage and communicate about what they see and what questions they have. Our moderation team is supportive and understanding. We know you have a life outside of Reddit, and we expect you to put that life first. Sometimes that means you might have less time to moderate and that's okay. We expect communication and coordination so that we can support each other and bring in more help when we need to.

# Anything I should know before I apply?

Yes, [r/Anxiety](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/) is a support community for anxiety and other related illnesses and we often encounter posts and comments that describe traumatic experiences or crisis. Some of this content can be disturbing.

Our team policy is that when a post or comment is too much for one of us to handle, we let the rest of the team know and someone else will step in to handle it, *but there is no way to eliminate the exposure completely*.

If you apply, please expect that we will ask you about your comfort level in moderating content of this nature and what strategies you might use to make sure your own mental health needs are met.

No one is expected to address issues that are uncomfortable for them, but you should expect to encounter such things if you join the team.

Second, we require that moderators join our Discord server, where we communicate and coordinate our moderation efforts. Part of the application process includes joining us on that server for a chat. You will need a Discord account (can be an existing account if you have one).

# How do I apply?

If you are interested in joining our team, here is the process we follow:

1. Send us a [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) indicating that you are interested and include answers to the following questions:
   * What does mental health mean to you?
   * Why are you interested in being a moderator on r/Anxiety ?
   * In your opinion, what are some differences between a good moderator and a bad moderator?
2. We will review your [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=r/anxiety) and your application. If we find your answers satisfactory, we will send a form for you to fill out.
3. We will invite candidates we think might be a good fit to join us on our Discord server so we can interact and get to know each other before making a decision on extending an invitation to be a moderator.
4. New moderators on the r/Anxiety moderator team start out with a trial run that will last about three weeks. During that time, the trial moderator will have limited moderation responsibilities, both for evaluation and to help provide a structured way to get up to speed.

Thanks for reading, and we hope you apply!

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: Had this on and off rarely over years but it’s getting more common. I get this thing where I drink and water or whatever liquid I’m drinking gets stuck either in my throat or my chest. I’m choking or drowning. I’m gasping for breath. It’s so sudden and I jolt up gasping for air.it’s so scary. I can’t get breathe in or out and the liquid is choking me. Something then releases and I splutter the drink all over the place. I then feel like it’s slightly in my lungs but I’m not really coughing so it’s not like it’s gone down the wrong pipe. I am not asking for medical advice. just some advice and if anyone else gets it. My mum said she’s had it and calls it an air lock, she said I’ve sucked in air too quickly as I’ve drank. But I don’t  know, I didn’t feel like I did. I just had it now and it’s scared the hell out of me. I’ve been having trouble swallowing recently,I can’t eat and drink very well recently just had a normal barium swallow test so I just don’t know anymore. Please tell me there’s someone else who gets this. And what is it

Original Idea: Sometimes, completely out of the blue, I’ll feel this strange wave hit me, almost like dissociation, a sudden hot flash, and my vision going a bit blurry all at once. It usually only lasts about 2–5 seconds, but in the moment it feels so real and unsettling.

It’s not every day, and it doesn’t seem tied to anything specific, but it catches me off guard each time. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

Original Idea: When I first took Lexapro, it started working after about two weeks, and I felt like a normal person. I had literally zero depression and anxiety. Unfortunately, the medication stopped working (or weakened significantly) after about three to four weeks. I continued taking Lexapro for another three months, hoping I'd feel happy again, but unfortunately, I didn't. Did you find a medication that helped you long-term and cured you completely?

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: I get pretty shaky in my hands and arms when I am a very anxious, usually in a social situation such as giving a presentation or even just someone watching me perform a task with my hands.  I do the 4-4-4 breathing method, but it only helps a bit.  I'm not sure exactly how noticeable this shaking is to others, but when I look at my hand it is very noticeable to me.  I've heard meditation can help people with this, and I've been trying to do breathing mindfulness meditation for 10 minutes a day, but I haven't noticed a difference so far.  From what I understand, the reason I'm shaking is the "fight or flight" response which spikes adrenaline.  Does meditation actually lower this baseline (are there studies that prove this?), but mostly I want to know if any of you have personal experiences with shaking anxiety and meditation.

Original Idea: I was diagnosed with GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) a few months ago and started medication right after, I take Paxera 20 mg (Turkish medication, similar to Paxil) and I logged how it has changed my life for the better:


at first paxera turned me into an emotionless zombie. it felt as if my head was turned into concrete. i didn’t feel like myself at all. but i was also fine with it because the crazy anxiety attacks i used to have before medication was much much worse than feeling numb. other than my crippling anxiety, paxera also made me realize that i had an anger management problem. normally my mom would say shit that would turn me into a raging monster but during my first few days of paxera i found myself calmly explaining why the stuff my mom was saying was pissing me off. and she understood, said she’ll keep that in mind. normally i’d start yelling lol.  

then after like 5 days of switching to full dose i started feeling like myself again. i was making jokes and stuff. everything felt more lively, minus the anxiety. 

then i started working as a receptionist at this hotel. there was some minor bullying and hazing (some days my managers would really cross the line and straight up attack me) that would normally send me into an anxiety spiral, making me question my existence and shit lol. but i took em like a champ. i was very strong. i didn’t realize this at the time but now that i’m looking back, that shit would make me weep at night. in my head of course. i couldn’t cry before and paxera hasn’t made it any easier lol

aaand fast forward to now. the immense calming effects of paxera has definitely worn off. i’m happy about this as i didn’t like that i was literally gandhi at first lol. but those first few weeks opened my eyes about how my approach towards the outside world affects how i end up feeling as well. even though it’s not as easy anymore, i’m working to keep calm under situations that would normally send me into an anxiety spiral or cause me to get really mad and do things that aren’t very proactive to the problem at hand. i’m SO happy that i started medication man. it’s not a magic pill that fixes my problems, it’s a helping hand teaching me how to fix my problems myself. exactly how i wanted it to be, i was so scared that it was gonna be a “magic pill” lol i don’t want to be dependent on anything to be a functional person


I still feel anxiety. I still have to do breathing exercises every once in a while. I still get angry, wanting to lash out and relieve my overwhelming emotions without thinking. But Paxera has taught me that there is a better way to approach these problems.

I’m super grateful that I didn’t listen to people’s judgy opinions about antidepressants, medication is quite literally saving my life. I love who I’m turning into.

Original Idea: I (33F) have been diagnosed with iron deficiency couple months ago. Doc started medicine but my levels didn’t go higher as much as we wanted. So he referred me to a gastroenterologist.

Gastro doc ordered an endoscopy and colonoscopy tho he didn’t seemed worried and was kinda making sure if everything was ok. 
I had the procedure two weeks ago and now waiting for biopsy results. But other than my iron levels I had lost considerable amount of weight in the last months- tho I’ve been under tremendous amount of stress.

As I wait I started to think that I might have cancer that spread all over my body, I might be in the point of no return, even if endoscopy results are good, it might be in the other areas of my body like pancreas e.g. 
because of I think I have cancer, even tho maybe just anxiety I’ve started to develop back pain now, I don’t feel very well, don’t eat very well I even check my eyes out every couple hours to check if I have jaundice cause I read this is a sign of pancreatic issues. 

I tried to talk to ai but its advices are garbage.
I don’t have any friend or family I can share. Though im not looking for medical advice, I’m open for some ideas, ( I can’t watch shows or read books either as I’m too agitated) maybe hearing people who’ve been through similar processes can help me.

Original Idea: My birthday is on Friday, I’m turning 25, But I don’t want to be alive anymore. I’ve been struggling with severe panic disorder and ocd my entire life, and was diagnosed at 5 years old. Had a very traumatic and confusing childhood, was bullied, wanted friends so badly but could never keep one. Was always awkward, dumb, struggled with body image and weight, could only ever connect with people online because I have such debilitating anxiety. The only time I got attention is when guys want to have sex with me. I am pretty i will give myself that. But that’s it. I can’t keep a job for the life of me because of my anxiety. It feels like everything is falling apart. I think I’m supposed to die young. I just want this pain to end. I have no one and nothing. All there is suffering. I only love animals so much. The idea of them keeps me alive. When my rabbit passed in November I feel like I lost my entire heart. I just want to be with her again. 
I’m so sorry if this is annoying and too much. I just have no one to talk to and I feel so alone. I do want help and I want hope.

Original Idea: I am starting a new job soon , really big career shift, i was feeling anxious and wanted to secretly stop showing up, or that i get suddenly rejected, but now i believe in myself

i see the same embers that burned all of that opposition of self inflicted anxiety to ash, i see the darkness that will shroud me from the fake light that is my survival mode

my brain will not hamper me from experiencing new things, i will do it, and i will be scared, and will mess up, and will make mistakes, and will learn as well, the true meaning of life is suffering because you wouldn’t know the happy days if everything was going as expected and planned, it’s a growing pain, i have to learn how to dance in the rain, and when the rain goes through my umbrella unexpectedly, i will do my best to enjoy it

Original Idea: I have GAD and a immunodeficiency with perhaps Neuroinflammation. My problem is severe exhaustion, fatigue and tiredness. Most likely through the immunodeficiency.


Last Friday I started with 50mg and the morning and evening and immediately felt good, awake, with way less anxiety and motivated, fatigue was also gone.i could sleep, woke up early and was fit.

No sedation and my thinking was clear for the first time in 20 years. I also had no side effects first, but now it feels the full side effects kick in: 


Now after the first 5 days it feels like the full side effects kick in: Vertigo, headache, dizziness, gut problems and nausea.


I could cry, is this going to be better and back to the initial effect? I was wondering to get these side effects so late.

Has anyone got any tips for how to stay calm when they go outside or if they feel a panic attack coming?

Original Idea: When you have a mental health issue, do you go to a therapist first or a psychiatrist? I went to my primary care last year and had mental health screening and was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, my PCP prescribed me zoloft and hydroxyzine, and honestly I haven't took any of those for months because I wanted to feel better without them, but recently (I guess with from many factors) my anxiety is back and is now taking my ability to work (that I constant want to leave from work) and secluded myself from others.

Last year I had a couple of sessions with a therapist but I didn't feel like I was liking it, and now I want to find one or maybe now better to go to a psychiatrist altogether? But I am not sure what do I need to do as a start? Ps: will they also provide me a doctor's note for my absence from work?

Original Idea: So I started having panic attacks randomly about two months ago, I kept coming back to the ER, then I got prescribed Ativan as needed which I took exactly as needed once every couple of days I’d take a .5mg for panic, I’d take one before doctor’s visits occasionally or else I’d panic. About 3 weeks ago ,I went in for an MRI which I couldn’t do because I would panic when they stuck me in the machine. That day I took 1mg Ativan and it didn’t help me much for the MRI. But after that I didn’t take an Ativan for about 10 days because I felt like I didn’t need to up until July 18th I took that 1mg Ativan and a day or two after I took a .5mg then for the next days I hadn’t taken an Ativan up until August 5th for a really really bad panic attack that day I took 1.5mg and since August 5th my panic attacks have gotten worse and I’ve increase my frequency in taking Ativan. Maybe a .5mg when I wake up and another near the time I go to sleep. So in summary for the past two months I’ve intermittently used benzos to stop panic attacks and since August 5th I’ve increased my intake of them, I’m fairly sure I have somewhat of a dependency on them which I’ll go through whatever withdrawal I don’t care, but I’m really really worried if I’ll have a seizure or possibly die from not using them anymore. I already skipped when I usually take them today  and feel okay just anxious about them causing a horrible health scare. Can I get some advice or some reassurance or anything? 

Edit: I’m sorry for bad formatting, I’m kinda going through it right now.

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: Hi I think I’ve developed severe anxiety over the past month and a half. I’m starting college in a couple of weeks, but I always feel like something bad will happen. It started with remembering some driving mistakes that I’ve made and ruminating on them. These days I can’t drive myself anymore. It’s gotten a lot worse to the point I’m obsessing over not electrocuting myself and recently I visited and had my first panic attacks when I stayed at an apartment on the 4th floor. In the apartment I was struggling a lot with intrusive thoughts. It’s like I was sooo close to jumping out of a window (call of the void) and hurting myself but I have no suicidal ideations. I’m Christian and reading the Bible helped me in this but I still felt REALLY weird toward those heights. I was scared I’d just snap and then hurt myself. I’d also ruminate about if I accidentally crossed a road wrong and got hit by a car. I’m back at home now but now I just keep thinking about all the times i could’ve died in the past couple years if something just went wrong. All of these are because of my own stupidity. Like I could’ve fallen asleep while driving bc I stayed up or drowned while intoxicated. it’s putting a lot of stress on me. I’d think of a past scenario and my heart starts racing and I’d get really thirsty and not want to leave my room. And I cant stop myself from thinking about it. I can’t live anymore without thinking abt something horrible

I plan on getting therapy/mental health help in college, but wanted to ask if anyone had any advice

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: Hey all, I'm struggling with anxiety from change. Back at the beginning of this year, I started a new fully remote job. Thinking it was going to be great, it ended up being awful. It caused me severe anxiety from the isolation of wfh, and not feeling part of the team. I missed my old job that I was at for 3 years. I ended up on medications and eventually started feeling better.

Now, I just started another new job that is hybrid. Learning from the last time, I came into this one with caution; just starting slow and not having any sort of expectations. However, I'm finding myself struggling with anxiety again. This first week Im remote, and the isolation is awful. Due to the nature of the work, I don't believe I'm allowed to work from a public area like a coffee shop, or else I'd love to.

A few years ago I suffered severe anxiety after moving, twice. One year after another. I moved, and then anxiety would sink in. 

Another example is when my wife and I went to Europe for three weeks. I was anxious basically the entire time, especially in the countries where English isn't the native language. I felt very nervous and fearful about the unfamiliar surroundings.

I'm noticing a pattern here that I get severe anxiety from change and unfamiliarity. It makes me nervous about the rest of my life, because change and unfamiliar surroundings is part of life. Change of job, moving, vacationing somewhere new, etc.

Does anyone else experience this? If so, how do you deal with it?

Original Idea: 


So I know muscle soreness is normal after working out and I used to workout so I know what that feels like. I actually stopped working out 3 years ago because of my muscle tightness.

I really love working out but after working out I get muscle soreness on the right side of my body and I don’t know why and how to fix it. I’ve been working out like 5 weeks and the pains just getting worse.

If I workout it’s like the whole of my body is extremely tight and it’s literally from neck to my toes. I don’t workout my legs but after working out my right leg is extremely tight. My fingers are tight even my toes. 

I can’t really find anything online so no idea what it is. If I’m sitting down or laying I feel discomfort and tightness but if I move or I’m moving it feels like I’ve pulled a muscle and the pain in sharper.

It’s always the right side and just no idea what to do it’s giving me so much distress. My left side feels completely normal.

Now the only two things I think it might be is maybe a back issue like disc issues or maybe anxiety I have high anxiety which does cause me to have more tight muscles. 

Any ideas what this could be can anyone relate and how is this fixable. I have gone to the doctors and physios but here in UK they’re never thorough so they’ll tried to give me some stretches and pills but don’t actually investigate it unless I have had an accident or if I go private health care.

Original Idea: Does anyone else find it almost impossible to study when anxiety from other parts of life is overwhelming? I keep wondering if I’m just undisciplined, or if this is what happens when stress takes over.

I’m a uni student with ADHD and on the path to become a doctor(fingers crossed). In high school I could procrastinate and still get top grades, but university hit me hard. Without structure, my habits caught up to me, my grades dropped, and I eventually got an ADHD diagnosis in third year. It took me so long to realize I even had ADHD because mental health is so stigmatized in my family and even when I had to get help I had to go at it alone because I know my mom wouldn't be supportive. The diagnosis helped me understand myself, but I felt like I’d already lost so much time and confidence.

The MCAT has been my biggest hurdle. It's recommended to take it the summer after second year and so I booked it even though I knew I wasn't ready since I hadn't treated my ADHD yet but the pressure from my mom made me book it anyway. I ended up doing bad as expected but I had hope I could do better the next year. Third year I did a lot better in school, as I finally had medication for ADHD and so for the summer after third year,  I planned to study in my university town where I focus better, but couldn’t get a job to stay there for the summer, so I came home. Home is stressful, my parents always fight, and my mom is going through a major financial loss. I feel guilty leaving her alone in an unhappy home and the was a major part of why I came home for the summer as well, but being here makes it so much harder to study. I began this year's studying attempt with so much more confidence and even took a diagnostic which showed me that I had a good grasp on the content even before studying but I should've realized that I need structure and I can't study for something this content heavy and practice heavy when I'm anxious about other things. Even on medication of ADHD, I can only manage small bursts of studying, and the rest of the time my head is full of worries about my family, money, and my future. This anxiety leads me to a hopelessness that tells me there's no point in anything and that I should just give up. Without motivation I get no where with my studying and end up in a shame spiral that tells me I'm not smart enough for this and that I haven't worked enough for anything and that I deserve nothing.

My test is next week, and I’m nowhere near ready. I feel stuck, ashamed, and scared I’ve ruined my chances. I want this career badly, but anxiety has made it hard to even start, and guilt makes me feel like I'm never going to be cut out for this. I've already wasted so much time on this one test and it truly has demoralized so much.

If you’ve been through this , when outside stress makes studying feel impossible,  how did you handle it? How did you know you weren’t just lazy, and that you *did* want it badly enough?

Original Idea: hi all, i have a couple more questions for my zoloft friends. the past year or so i feel like im going crazy, zoloft helped with my anxiety, but i feel like it gave me so many more problems. please let me know if you have experienced any of this or if im making it up! 
to start, i feel overly compulsive- which i never was. now i have ocd tendencies like locking the door multiple times, or needing things my way or no way, i have severe overstimulation and irritability. the overstimulation is the main part because i never experienced it but minor things will set me off. i have little to no sex drive, i don’t even want to kiss my partner because the feeling of saliva on my lips overstimulates me. i’m so so so lazy, i can sleep for 24hrs straight if i wanted to, i have zero motivation to do anything. whether it’s going to the store or even reading an email, anything that requires the least bit of effort i don’t want to do (and i wont because i simply don’t have the capacity to care.) i want to get off of zoloft to see if it’s really me or the medication doing it. my biggest fear is that it’s me all along and i wont know how to fix it.

Original Idea: Hoping to get some feedback from people with lived experiences. 

I was in citalopram (celexa) for 6 years. I noticed lately, it was giving me headaches, making me groggy/sleepy during the day and it decreased my libido significantly (especially as of late). My doctor suggested I taper off and switch to Buspirone, an anxiolytic. I gradually tapered the citalopram, for almost 2 months and started the Buspirone only after my tapering was done. 

I have been on buspirone for about 6 weeks now, and suddenly I've started to feel physical symptoms of anxiety come back (excessive rumination to the point of not being able to focus on anything else, feeling of panic in stomach for no reason all the time). I am wondering if this is a delayed SSRI discontinuation syndrome, OR if my anxiety symptoms are just coming back, which means the Buspirone may not be helping much (gives me RLS at night too, and I have trouble falling asleep). I've noticed myself relying a bit too much on alcohol to calm my panic/anxiety over the last week or so.

I am also trying to take a break from THC, which could have something to do with all of this. 

Any feedback would be good. My pharmacist recommended maybe I get on Wellbutrin.

Original Idea: I’m 23 and honestly struggling a lot with feelings of not truly belonging to any of my friend groups. On paper, things are great: I have amazing friends, I’ve recently moved in with one of my best friends, I just got a pay rise, and my flat is beautiful. But despite all of this, I feel miserable and I can’t figure out why.

Here’s the situation: I know a lot of different people, and I get invited to everything, but it often feels like I’m always “joining in” rather than being part of an established group. There are pre-existing friend groups from university, living situations, or just people naturally gravitating toward each other, and I feel like I’m always coming into the middle of things.

Some examples: the guys from work have a group chat I’m not part of, and a new friend group I’ve formed over the past six months has a “house chat” that I’m not in , not because they dislike me, but because the chat is specifically for people living together. I know logically that none of this is personal, but it still hits me really hard.

I’ve also left some groups or fallen out with people in the past because they weren’t very nice, and seeing their friendship solidified without me makes me feel even more like an outsider. Even when friends tell me they love me and want me around, I can’t shake the feeling that I’m just “joining” rather than belonging.

I’m worried I’m overthinking and that these feelings might start to affect my friendships. I just don’t understand why I can’t feel like I truly fit in, even when everything looks fine on the surface. Why do I feel like this, and how can I stop overthinking and start feeling like I belong?

Thanks for reading any advice or insight would mean a lot.

Original Idea: Has anyone else experienced constant fear and panic that makes you feel like you’re going to die? Lately, my anxiety has skyrocketed, and it feels like it’s taken over my life. I’m constantly pacing, feeling dizzy, lightheaded, spaced out, fatigued, and weak. Overall, I just don’t feel well.

I tend to feel a little better by the end of the day, but mornings are the worst. I wake up with an overwhelming fear that I’m dying, and it’s completely disrupted my daily life. I can’t focus, get things done, or enjoy anything.

I feel so alone in this, and I just need to hear from someone who’s been through this and made it to the other side. I’m truly at my wit’s end

Original Idea: I recently started taking sertraline almost a week ago, and my anxiety has gotten so much worse to the point where I’ve thrown up because of it. I’m constantly having an anxiety attack, am nauseous, and having stomach problems. 

How do I deal with this? Is there any way to make it better?

(Add on: I’ve recently started in a new school, so my level of anxiety was high to begin with, but it’s never been as bad as it is right now)

Original Idea: I 19F have moved from my hometown to another country with my family and will start fashion school in a few weeks. The thought of being so far away from my city makes me so anxious and sad. I can’t even think about it because if I do I tear up. 
My best friend will start uni in another city too but she moved in with her childhood friend.
My other best friend is still in my hometown and will try to get a job there.
All the people I know have moved from home and started to take responsibilities and make decisions for their future. But I feel so overwhelmed with the changes and I am scared that I won’t like this new life here and that I will waste my younger years feeling sad and missing home. I will study 4 years in this town and after that I will move back home hopefully.
I am scared that I wont make any friends here and that I will be all alone. The people in this school are very different from the people I usually hang out with but we do share a common interest : fashion design; but what if I don’t find a friend in that new university. Also I really want to move out and start my own life because I still feel like a child when I am home and I want to be adult and independent.
I feel like I am missing out on my own life. I also feel anxious because I have never had a boyfriend and I am afraid I won’t meet anyone and be all alone. This anxiety makes me so tired and keeps me up at night.
Has anyone had a similar experience or felt similar feelings ?

Original Idea: hello all! i’ve been on zoloft for about 2 years or 1.5 yrs. i started on 50, then a couple months later went on 75, a couple months after that back down to 50, and decided it was doing more harm than good and i wanted to fully get off of them. i stayed on 50 for a while and then dropped down to 25 and have been on those for maybe 2-3 months. i noticed the occasional vertigo as i dropped down the first week but nothing other than that. i ran out of my 25mg and the doctor has yet to contact me back about a refill and i have been off of them for about 3 days. i’m not noticing anything crazy besides the very very slight, almost nonexistent vertigo. i have a couple questions. 1.) will i be okay health wise if i decide to not take any again. 2.) how long will the side effects last, and what are they? i dont know because ive only been on them for about 2 years and ive been on 25 for months. 3.) should i get a refill or see how i feel, will it damage me to decide i cant do withdrawal by myself and take a pill? i’m more nervous seeing all the side effects people talk about, is it a one size fits all or everyone reacts different? i really really want off but if the withdrawal gets severe is it okay to take one or will it damage anything? i’ve been meaning to set up an appointment and discuss a tapering but they haven’t gotten back to me in 3 days. thanks for the help guys

Original Idea: I’m sure this question has been asked multiple times, but how do y’all stop overthinking/over-dissecting text conversations when no one said anything wrong?

For context, my boyfriend met a guy not long ago and they have been clicking. I’ve seen this guy twice and the vibes are great. Now, my boyfriend is moving abroad so I’m in this anxious state looking for new friends and new connections. So I’m anxious/nervous that once my boyfriend leaves, this new guy won’t want to be my friend given that he connected with my boyfriend first. 

I find myself asking my boyfriend all the time “has he texted you? Have yall spoken?”  He shows me the messages, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong/weird, but I’ll overthink and dissect every single message. This will be in my head for 2-3-4 days and it’s the only thing I can think about. Why did he say this, why this emoji, interesting that he messaged after X hours of not talking, etc etc. 

I know that I can’t control how this guy will feel towards me once my bf leaves. I also know that this guy has a life before and will have a life after. But my brain can’t stop thinking and overthinking about all the possible scenarios. Will he be my friend? Can I invite him to so and so event? Will he ghost me?

Original Idea: A lot of advice online seems to advise emphasizing that you are struggling and such but I do not think that would be a good approach with my parents. I do not think they would take it particularly seriously and, if they did, it wouldn't help much beyond making them worried and when my parents become worried, they tend to take it out on me and it's very difficult to achieve anything productive. 

What are some more casual explanations or benefits that I could maybe cite as a reason for seeking therapy? I considered just talking about self-improvement and how it might help me do better in school but I don't think that alone is enough to justify the cost of therapy.

Original Idea: I don’t even know where to go with this since I can’t afford therapy or anything.
I have severe anxiety and fear of failure and it’s absolutely ruining my life in every way shape and form. 
I have severe fear of failure, I’m in a tech related major and the job market is complete rubbish. I’m feeling like an imposter more and more every single day, I feel like the bar has been set so incredibly high now due to AI and I NEED to improve my technical skills but I’m completely frozen. I’m graduating next year and I havent done any internships and feel like I’m completely done for. If you think I’m overthinking this and secretly an A+ student, I promise you I am not. This is taking over my life. The panic, the failure, the comparing myself to my peers, the severe insomnia I have now because I stay up all night thinking about this until my body is physically exhausted and I have to fall asleep, the wanting to learn everything but learning absolutely nothing with no clear roadmap. 
I don’t know what to do anymore. I had an interview today as well and my face started becoming very hot down to my neck and back while the rest of my body was freezing, and when the interview ended I looked down at my knees and thighs to find them all scratched up and bleeding. Please believe me when I say I had absolutely no idea I was doing this the whole interview!! I was unintentionally harming myself physically without even noticing and using my body as a stress toy. This is how bad it’s gotten. My nervous system is out of whack. My head is all over the place.
Not to mention the lovely physical effects anxiety has on you: 
- Nausea 
- Severe gagging
- Hot flashes and sweating on some body parts while others are freezing cold.
- Literally feeling like my lungs have collapsed because I can’t breathe.
- Racing thoughts that literally attack your brain and severe insomnia.
- Hands always shaking hard it almost looks like I have Parkinsons.

Original Idea: 2 nights ago I got really anxious because I was having worse heart palpitations than usual and ended up in the hospital which made me even more anxious. All my tests (Bloods and EKG) were normal and only my heart rate was high due to being so scared. 

I signed myself out because I felt my heart rate would drop more at home and it did after a while but I’m still constantly checking myself and being scared about my heart. 

I spoke to my GP and he told me it’s most likely anxiety and that it’s a very low chance I have a heart related problem. Even with all the reassurance from doctors I’m still so anxious and I feel like I’m on my own. My Apple Watch is making me check everything constantly like ECG and heart rate and it comes back normal every time but the ECG looks different than others using the same watch. 

I just want to know that I’m not on my own with this 😭

Does anyone know if this side effect dissipates or is this likely to continue?

Original Idea: My heart was racing so hard yesterday that I felt like I would never be able to breathe again. I discovered something so strange at that very moment that I nearly burst out laughing.

I reached for a tiny toy I always carry in my pocket—one of those flexible little cubes—and, rather than concentrating on the panic, I simply pressed, stretched, and folded it. This instantly brought me back to the present.

In a matter of seconds, my breathing slowed. It worked even though it didn't make sense.

When anxiety strikes, little things like that can occasionally be the most effective lifelines.

What strange little trick does it work for you? Come on, let's share. Perhaps we can support one another in escaping our next panic attack.

(This is a secure environment; you don't need to use this coping mechanism.)

Long story short I feel like I’m going insane, my phone and thoughts were a bit distorted and the little bit of sleep I got last night resulted in a terrible dream night mare that I couldn’t get out of even tho I knew it had to be a dream. 
I just really hope that I’m not losing my mind or set back my panic disorders that bad. 
I just hate feeling like I’m going crazy. I almost much rather the physical symptoms of anxiety. 
I’m not sure what to do

Original Idea: i was on generic lexapro (escitalipram oxilate i think) and i and now weaned off it, because it wasn’t doing anything for my social anxiety or ocd or depressive episodes, so basically i was taking a medication for fun 😒. now a month after being weaned, i don’t want to go back on an ssri because of the SWEATS. but also i feel like i am mentally strong enough to deal with my thoughts. but here’s my issue. my physical anxiety symptoms have come back. i wake up short of breath, not because of an actual health reason, im just ALREADY filled with anxiety. i’m shaking like a crusty little dog. i’m so nauseas and have trouble eating because i have no appetite when im anxious. i’m going to get blood work and then revisit my doctor and ask what her opinions are on beta blockers. just want some experiences and advice before i go, anything helps.

Original Idea: Hello, I'm posting this in hopes to get some advice or get some insight on how others deal with this. I obviously have anxiety, have for as long as I can remember. It's always greatly affected my digestive system but it's been really bad lately. I live in an environment where I'm constantly anxious and don't feel comfortable in my own home (living with family am i right? 🥲) And I'm almost always experiencing stomach pains so bad that it prevents me from sleeping and I'm just always feeling unwell. 

Unfortunately I'm not in a position where I can leave the environment I live in. I'm in therapy, I go on walks very regularly to get out of the house and of course exercise is so helpful with anxiety and just in general. I'm trying to ease my anxieties the best I can. But I have so many surrounding factors that are working against me and my health. 

Ultimately I'm just feeling really helpless in the matter and any knowledge or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you're doing well ❤️

Original Idea: I’m transferring to a new university to finish my bachelors but I don’t know anyone at the school and I’m super anxious about starting at a new place. I’ve registered to attend some events during welcome week but they are a week away and I’m already a wreck about it. I’m living in a house off campus so I don’t have a roommate to go with and I am already feeling to anxious to go to these events alone. What if no one wants to talk to me? What if I’m the only person that shows up alone? Ugh I hate it but I don’t not want to make friends. I had a lot of good friends at my previous university, I don’t know why I’m so on edge about it now, I want to throw up just thinking about it. Any help for transferring students?

Original Idea: So I am M26 and have been living with anxiety/DPDR since I was young. While the panic attacks and DPDR episodes have been sort of up and down since I was about 17 with some weeks/months/years being better or worse than others, I’d say I have at the very least gained a much better understanding of it than I used to have. I’ve been in working in retail/customer service since I was 18 (which probably hasn’t helped much but it’s all I’m qualified to do). 

There have been a few careers over the years that I’ve at least been interested in if not full on wanted to try. But I swear every time I even mention it online even if it’s just something as simple as “I’m interested in (X) and looking for advice” and people find out I have a history of anxiety or depression, all the responses I get are negative to the point that I don’t even want to mention it anymore because people just ruin it. 

“I’m interested in becoming an EMT” “don’t do it, you won’t be able to take care of people”

“Im interested in joining the military” “why would you want to join if you’re anxious and depressed? You would just be a liability”

“Im interested in volunteering in conflict zones”
“Just send money, you would do more harm than good because of your mental state”

Like okay I get it, I have issues. Is it so hard to believe that MAYBE I might be able to overcome them and do something with my life? Sorry never mind, I’ll just stay in retail for the rest of my life because according to basically everyone I’m too weak or damaged to do anything worthwhile. This shit makes me want to walk off into the woods and never talk to people again. Sorry for the rant, just tired of it.

Original Idea: It started with a simple plan: gather the sources I need for my project.
Now I’m drowning in them.

Every time I try to organize, my brain freezes. My chest tightens. There’s this restless, buzzing energy under my skin, like I need to do something, but I can’t stick with it long enough to make progress.

I’m diagnosed with OCD and ADHD, and I can’t tell if this is one, the other, or both — but I feel like I’m about to explode. I’ve already collected all the information I need (maybe too much), but the moment I try to sort it, I get stuck.

It’s exhausting and frustrating, and I don’t know how to push through this mix of overwhelm, anxiety, and restlessness without burning out.

Has anyone experienced this? How do you actually get your work organized when your brain is fighting you every step of the way?

Original Idea: hey, i am 19 year old female. I feel like when i was 8-9 I had my first GAD experience, and ever since that i have never been in total peace. Its so stupid to think, i was like 9 and my cousin was born who i loved so very much, and suddenly i got this feeling that everyone in my family die and i have to take care of my cousin, i used to literally think what will i feed him and how we will be homeless. Like i had no idea i had this problem. Right now also, I have like nothing to worry about but its like my brain constantly thinking about problems or threat i could have in future, right now my worries lie in what if something happens to my family, what if i loose my apartment, what if i loose my close friends. Like i had never talked about this to anyone because i felt like it was my problem, but it has gotten so bad that i get headaches. Like i don't want to feel this way, i wanna be more relaxed. Iike everything is going fine and i wanna be fine as well. Recently I got to know about GAD, and i felt like i related to it like alot so i wanted to make this post. Any genuine advice to get rid of these or at least to feel a bit better .

Original Idea: Since I've been sa'd multiple times in my life, I've developed anxiety about going out, being around men,etc... 

But it honestly sucks so much cuz it sometimes ruin my life and I've talked about it to a friend who told me that I have to fix this issue if I wanna live normally. And I do want that. I wanna stop living in fear and anxiety.

However, I don't see how I could stop being anxious over these stuff since there are so many chances that what I've been through would happen again. Not being anxious over a danger that exists it's just impossible to me. It's like being told that you should stop being afraid of lions while being in the middle of a cage of hungry felines.
Idk if that makes sense..

Original Idea: Man whenever my anxiety starts popping up it always does so by disrupting my sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night heart racing, covered in sweat, and feel like I could just explode with how restless I get. I think the hardest part is knowing I need the rest and not being about to get it which in turn makes me more anxious. I always fall asleep easily and during the day most of the time I feel better but man oh man I struggle when I wake up in the night. How about y’all anyone else deal with something similar? I’ve gone whole nights just getting like a couple hours of sleep before and then have to wake up and get on with my day which isn’t fun but it’s nice to know I can get through my days even with a lack of sleep

Original Idea: I've tried several times and it always feels like if anything the effectiveness is *reduced*, let alone faster acting.

So much so , that I feel like they must be designed like that as a safety feature for preventing a misuse of the prescription, i.e. tablet for oral use only. Whereas there are other forms of the drug for different administration.

I've tried leaving it in and not swallowing for as long as fifteen minutes and it seems like there is residue that doesn't dissolve, which, maybe there's other ingredients (or the active one) that don't absorb through bodily linings.

Original Idea: Night time, specifically after sundown, my anxiety really spikes. Every sound makes me jump, I see things in shadows, I won’t walk into a room with the lights off. I have to sleep with a nightlight. If my girlfriend falls asleep before me it’s basically game over, I can’t sleep (i write this as she is asleep). I’m a grown adult but I feel like a child and like I’m crazy. I mean genuinely I’m hearing and seeing things that aren’t there, I’m scared of closets and leaving the bedroom door open. I’m terrified someone will break in and kill us. I don’t know what to do. Most nights my girlfriend will try and soothe me enough to sleep but this is so embarrassing to have to do as an adult. What can I do?

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: I've been like this all day. Basically here is an explaination:

I have this friend, who is deeply suicidal. The thing is, he doesn't want help, doesn't care for it. And says he will kill himself. And that, there is no changing his mind.

I have even suggested medication, but he doesn't want it. He has intrusive thoughts just like me, I have OCD so I know how hard it is. And I know meds do genuienly help. But he genuienly doesn't want it.

There was a converstation we had yesterday which, I don't know if I said something wrong, or if I did something wrong. Please let me know.

All this started when I suggested antidepresants, because it does help me. He said no, and that, he didn't want his brain to be "altered by meds". Which. Felt really invalidating. Like genuienly. I didn't dwell on it tho. Due to his situation.

He has been saying that death is his only way out and that, there is no world he lives for long, stuff like that. The thing is, I have experienced the loss of a family and this triggers me bad.

It kind of made me snap in the moment and I asked why he isn't even considering other solutions. Like I wanted an explaination at this point. 

I also told him how much I cared and how I could not handle loss of another person after the first one, and thats was the reason why I was suggesting this.

He explained why, how much he hated everything, and more. And he has all the right to hate everything, with all that's he's been through.

I tried to do more comforting. Which, I think it fell on deaf ears. Like how I would be there for him and care. And would do anything to help, and try to keep him alive.

But he said that it would be ok and we would both be ok.

I was crying at this point, like full on bawling. Idk if what I did was wrong but I told him I wouldn't be ok if he died. I said I was barely even ok when I experienced the last loss, and even tiny details from it. And now that I'm all grown up, knowing this and not being able to prevent it would kill me. I genuienly poured my heart out. To try and show him how much I care.

Then he apologized for even befriending me in the first place while knowing that he would not live for long. But one thing he said that tipped me off was "if you truly mean what you say" which again, made me feel invalidated, due to how much events in my life have effected me.

I ignored it though, but now thinking back, it genuienly stings, but I also dont blame him because he is convinced that everything could easily be a simulation. He suffers from derealization aswell, so it's understandable.

After that I just told him to never say that he shouldn't have befriended me and that, he is the most amazing person I've ever met.

After that convo ended shortly. I havent been able to properly calm down and its been a day. I don't know if I said something wrong, but I also feel kinda angry and take this with the grain of salt:

I'm genuienly angry at him for telling me that someday he will kill himself. And that, he won't seek help. I don't get why he is telling me this. To make it easier on me? That makes it way harder. Knowing and not being able to help. I genuienly can't cope with this while he is alive, let alone if he dies, what would I even do with myself? I would never live with the guilt. It's like I'm put under pressure where I can't do anything to stop it. I want to help but can't, and if he won't accept help then I can't help. I can't just say I'm fine with it because I can't just be an accomplice im this progressing suicide. I genuienly feel so stuck.  

What can I even do? I don't know and I just need help badly at this point. Does anyone have any advice?

Neither you want to but still get disturbed by not having a partner, gf , relationship or date or even a prospective match. I am aleedy disturb As i literally have nothing to do. also, with this Sciatica pain, I cant go to gym. Had I been in Gym, I wouldn't mind this much as much Ia m feeling it right now. Not only that I don't want to look classy myself or be better at communication due to all this anxiety or overwhelming . Agreed, take small steps to reach goals, thtat also is difficult. I am watching DBT skills, that too after so many days to watch another video of 5 mins. this is being in more regret and spiralling emotions. I am so sad that sometimes I feel like crying but don't know the reason which triggered me this.  Also, this dating is already shit, then why should I had put my feet and don't get a single prospect not good photo, write god bio. but still not getting good pictures clicked even. Not even want to but still want to date and roam. that' s stupid. This is spiralling all into regret that even if I get marry, would I be able to enjoy my life. and so much. Why so many emotions. FOMO, etc.

Original Idea: After school one day, I had to read an essay I wrote. I was a new student, usually a good student in class, but anxiety has always been part of my life.

When the teacher called me, I stood up and started reading. I was trembling so much that I could barely make a sound. My breathing got heavy, and everything on my paper started to blur. I couldn’t focus, my eyes couldn’t see clearly.

Eventually, I had to stop and tell the teacher I couldn’t continue. I went back to my seat. That day is probably one of the most embarrassing moments of my life.

Original Idea: 



Hey friends,
I want to talk about something I’ve been learning that’s helped me a LOT. Bracing.  

Bracing is when your body stays tight without you even realizing it—shoulders up, jaw clenched, stomach held in, etc. For many neurodivergent people (including autistic and ADHD folks), this isn’t just about stress or anxiety. It’s something our bodies do automatically to feel “ready” for the world. The problem is if you stay braced too long, it wears you out, makes pain worse, and can mess with how you move.

What to try:
	•	Notice your shoulders. Are they up by your ears? Gently let them drop.
	•	Put your hand on your belly. Can you take a slow breath without lifting your chest?
	•	Check your jaw. Is it tight? Try resting your tongue on the roof of your mouth but keep it soft.

This isn’t about “fixing” your posture or being perfect.  It's about giving your body a break from constant tension. Small changes, practiced often, can make a big difference over time.

Have you noticed yourself bracing? What helps you release it?

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: So for context; I went to visit one of my longtime best friends out of state for 5 days. I tend to feel anxious when I’ve been around people for too long and I haven’t had my time to decompress but I figured this would be fine as she’s my best friend and she tends to fill my cup. I left on the 7th. 

I’m not sure if this is just exacerbated anxiety but I’ve felt very weird ever since the 10th and it’s gotten worse since. It feels like after drinking anxiety/disassociation but also very different, because I didn’t really drink liquor and even when I do drink too much wine it’s not nearly this intense. It became kinda difficult to even share excitement or feel genuinely happy a few days in, it felt like my nervous system was malfunctioning. 

Internally I feel detached from my body and trapped in it at the same time. I was relying on the familiarness of streets or my childhood neighborhood to ground me but everything felt really strange yesterday when I got home. As if I didn’t 100% recognize my surroundings, like I was in an alternate reality somehow, something was just off. I just looked it up and it sounds like derealization? It also feels really overwhelming right now for me to talk to or be around anyone, even the people that normally ground me. I’m not suicidal but these feelings lead me to feel like it’s very hard to live in this state and it’s hard to feel like I’m ever going to return to normal. I honestly just want to shut myself in my room for days, I don’t feel like I can handle anything more. 

I know this cant be normal but I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt like this? It feels like there’s something deeply wrong with me and I think it’s only contributing to these feelings idk.

## Mental Health - Anxiety
Original Idea: I'm a high school senior, and I've never felt more anxious and worried in my entire life.

I was very lazy throughout high school, and my grades suffered because of it, it wasn't until the second semester of my Junior year until I started really caring about school. My obsession over looking at college stats and comparing myself to successful people in fields I'm interested in (business, law, and politics) has taken over my life.

I've lost hours of time looking up researching every single person I see in a Financial Times or Bloomberg video or podcast to see where they went to college. I've researched tens of politicians seeing where they went. I've spent hours and hours just looking up average GPAs and SATs and being on LinkedIn looking for everyone's college.

This has taken over my life, and I've never felt so down on myself and hopeless before, but simultaneously, fearful of my future.

I feel like I'll never be enough.

Original Idea: I used to facetune my body in pictures I posted or sent to people. I have a lot of guilt and anxiety from it because I’m terrified people know or will find out. I don’t do it anymore, and I haven’t since high school/early college, but I can’t stop thinking about it. Has anyone else been through this?

Original Idea: I am supposed to go on a trip today that involves a 5 hour car ride (by myself), then 3 hour drive tomorrow to the beach. I have been anxious about it for weeks. What specifically makes me anxious? Driving, being out of my home, sharing a room with others/insomnia, figuring out parking, eating restaurant/boardwalk food for a week, being away from my husband, getting too much sun. Positives? seeing family and friends. I am crying scared, but feel like I can't let my anxiety "win". So here I sit.

Original Idea: Two years ago (2023), I (19M) moved to Toronto for uni.
That’s when I became the villain in my own story.

Before I left, I had this girl. She was a year younger — still in high school while I was starting uni. She gave me her whole heart, trusted me, showed me to her parents, and loved me in a way I’ll never get again.

I loved her too. But I was terrified.
Terrified of doing long distance.
Terrified she’d hook up with other guys while when she goes to uni while 
I sat in my dorm miserable. Plus I had only 1 year of dorms, while she had 4. 

So my brain came up with the dumbest “solution” ever:
If she ever does it… I’ll do it first. We’ll be even.

Petty. Insecure. Cowardly.
And I went through with it.

The second I got to uni, I started hooking up with other girls. Part of me was scared of leaving dorms as a loser. Part of me didn’t want to be the sad ex while she was out living her best life.

Meanwhile, she was in school, crying at night, going through hell. She’d still call me saying she missed me, and I’d comfort her… while knowing what I was doing behind her back.

The more I hooked up, the shittier I felt. Eventually, the flings ended. I went back to just talking to her, pretending nothing happened. We weren’t “official,” but we acted like we were. I even got jealous over other guys. Somehow, I went back home after 1st year and I was in a 3 month situationshop with her and broke up after she went to uni. She went to uni and treated me like absolute shit. I was w other girls but I made time to talk to her, but she never even spoke to me and had no clue what she was doing in uni. But no this trauma bond always had us coming back to each other and had me accepting this was more of karma’s play.

Fast forward: Valentine’s Day 2025. We get back together. I still keep the secret. She continued to treat me badly. I’d cry for hours,  it would ruin my social friendships, I went into heavy marjuana abuse, worst of all I took it. “This is my karma,” I told myself.

Then one day, I cracked. I told her — no details, just that I’d been with other girls.
That was it. Second chance gone.

What I did was wrong.
But I swear, I would do anything to give this girl the comfort and happiness she deserves. When I went back home a month ago, I was on my knees for her, trying to be the best man I could be one last time. She made memories with me, spent time with me, but made it clear she didn’t want a relationship w me again. At presence, I was the best to her, postive thinking, everything to be her ideal man but I was still kinda being treated weird. And I just let that walk over me in the name of “oh don’t react, it’s ur karma”. Idk why i punish myself like this and keep myself in this trauma bond.

I’m proud of her.
But I’m scared of myself.

Because my ex gave me everything… and I destroyed her home.
I made her cry so many nights.
And now I live with the fear that karma is just waiting to take away anyone I ever love again.

Call it trauma-induced behavior. Call it self-sabotage. I call it the biggest mistake of my life. st year.  Therapy is so expensive for me, I’ve called hotlines to prevent self harm, I’ve cried, I don’t ever wanna hurt anyone like this ever again, I don’t wanna live a lie again. But I need help, I need advice from someone who’s been in similar situations. How did anyone stop self sabotage, negativity, negative voices in their head, social anxiety, jealousy, insecurity, low self esteem. Man there’s sm and therapy is so fucking expensive 

TL;DR: 
I (19M) had a loving girlfriend a year younger than me before moving to uni in 2023. Out of fear she’d eventually hook up with other guys, I started hooking up with girls first to “be even.” She spent that year crying and struggling while I betrayed her. We stayed in a toxic on-and-off “trauma bond,” and when we finally got back together on Valentine’s Day 2025, I eventually confessed (without details). She left. Now I live with crushing guilt, anxiety, and self-sabotage — therapy is expensive, and I’m looking for advice on breaking the cycle of insecurity, jealousy, and low self-esteem.

Original Idea: I'm currently in a panic attack as I write this. And, it's hard to explain but, I know there's more I can do to help myself but my brain just.. won't let me. All it's letting me do is listen to music and play video games. But, it won't let me do other things that could help me like breathing, self care, grounding, etc. I feel paralyzed. Like on the one hand, I want to get rid of this panic attack so I can sleep. On the other hand I feel like I deserve this. Like if I calm down "too quick" I'm just faking it, and as if it's logical to be in a panic attack since people keep saying it's things I SHOULD be anxious about (the current US political climate). Like its insensitive to calm down. 

Idk if this is just some weird form of self harm or what but... Does anyone else get this? What should I do about it?

Original Idea: I just got my permit and I’m practicing driving right now, this is my 2nd time driving and I almost crashed the car on a turn, thankfully the truck I was driving in was sturdy and didn’t scratch or mess up the car. My legs feel shaky even though I drove me and my moms boyfriend (he’s teaching me) back home slowly, I know I shouldn’t feel this way but it keeps replaying in my mind. All was going well and now I feel like I messed up this image of me in my moms boyfriends mind of being a decent starter. I always want to look good in peoples eyes deep down which makes it 10x harder for me to get over things I mess up on.

Original Idea: a vent since i feel like such a failure. i interned at a company this summer-- I like the environment, my supervisor, my coworkers, and the work I was doing. everything was going good throughout the past 11 weeks I was there, and aside from some anxiety the first day, everything was going off without a hitch. for context, I've been on anxiety meds since I had somewhat of a mental breakdown in January 2021. I've been taking 20 mg of prozac since, but eventually weened off years later this january with doctor's approval. the past few months without the meds have been fine. i felt anxiety at times from school, starting a new job, and family stuff, but nothing I couldn't manage.

everything went to shit two weeks ago. i randomly had a panic attack after years of not having one for years, and it caused me to absolutely spiral and lose my shit. i ended up taking 4 sick days off from work (I lied that I caught an illness) simply because I couldnt do anything else than lay in bed, shake, and vomit from the anxiety. i mustered up the will to go back to work and had to take multiple antihistamines a day to keep me sedated enough to not have a panic attack in the office. i ended up leveling out my emotions after a week and felt almost back to normal. unfortunately, I actually caught a cold this past friday and it caused me to spiral yet again into a huge mess of anxiety. anyways, I forced myself to go to work Monday and Tuesday despite not sleeping for the past 48 hours from having panic attacks and vomiting. however, after yet another sleepless night, I  decided that I just can't go to work anymore. i just messaged my supervisor that I need to resign today, a week early from my end date, due to a medical emergency. i just got off the phone with him (where I was holding back tears like a loser mind you), and he was very understanding and seemed genuinely concerned about this "medical crisis" I was having.

i just feel so disappointed in myself that I let the anxiety win. I've been doing so good the past few years and over the course of just 10 days, I feel like I'm back at square one.

this internship offered me a job post grad a week ago, but now I feel that my random "health crises" totally destroyed my credibility, and I feel that they are going to rescind the offer. i will be speaking with HR later to see if there's any way I can save this situation as I would really want to work with this company. its not easy getting a job in my field right now, which makes this hurt even more. I'm sick to my stomach and furious that I couldn't even muster up to go to my last week of work and leave off on a good note. i am so exhausted with myself and this condition.
