It makes me lonely from within. But the problem is im forced to attend. If i try to avoid others force me or make faces. I am left out and others avoid me. What do i do in such situations?

I'm a long-time follower of your videos and appreciate how you cover India’s complex issues with clarity and depth. I’d like to request a video on the Soujanya case — a 17-year-old girl from Belthangady, Karnataka, who was raped and murdered in 2012.

Despite clear evidence of brutality and growing public outcry, the case has seen minimal media attention and no justice even after 12 years. Allegations of political pressure and institutional failure make this a critical case to investigate.

Your style of data-driven storytelling could help bring this issue back into public consciousness and push for accountability. Please consider making a video on this. It would mean a lot to many who still seek justice for her.

Thank you for your work!",other

When I open that product to view in details, to my surprise, the price was more expensive than EMI price, I mean leaving aside impulse shopping, these companies are not sparing on necessity items.

Rather than engaging in efforts that offer a true sense of achievement and personal growth, they often chase materialistic things to fill that void. Ironically, many can't even afford the lavish lifestyles or luxury products they admire, which leads to frustration and a deeper disconnect from reality.

Television was a thing then youtube became a thing now social media. It is inevitable every generation has their own trends and youth thats obsessed with it one way or another. Since social media is widely accessible it does have alot of influence on people in general, hence more people that follow the trend. Im a genz, me or neither of my frnds are into labubu or stanely. Again it depends on the individual wether they wanna follow the trend or not, just like the previous generations. dk why genz gets all the hate for random ass shit",other

As it is the youth of our country is literally growing up to be a pain in the ass (for us Indians and for foreigners too), plus our country is plagued with issues and there is no real vision of community development. Education, finance, sexuality jaisi cheezon pe humari govt. baat nahi karti hai aur identity crisis toh hume independence ke baad se hi virasat mein mili hai.

Why not society who only judge people on the base of money 

Why not government who never acknowledged gen z talent and give them path for their growth

I was born in 1996 and since the time I learnt about social media, it has never been an addiction to me. But there is a problem I've observed over the last 10 years, I guess. I had an addiction to reading storybooks in my childhood, but now, it is difficult to concentrate on them. Maybe that is due to the exposure to digital devices and more screen time (education or work related & YouTube while having meal).

I'm sure a lot of '90s kids are having this issue. If there is any solution that may help psychologically, please mention it.",Mental Health - Addiction

Whether it's intentional or not, many of them are pushing our youth in the wrong direction. But honestly, it's not entirely their fault. The real problem lies with us the young generation.
As soon as we see something trending on social media be it travel vlogs, luxury lifestyle, tech unboxing, fashion hauls, or viral reels we start copying it blindly. No one stops to ask: ‘Can I really afford this?’ or ‘Is this adding value to my life?’
What’s worse is that the influencers who actually share knowledge, wisdom, skills, and meaningful content hardly get any recognition. Why? Because most young people today are more focused on chasing status, upgrading their lifestyle, or spending weekends partying, instead of investing in personal growth.

9QIHzSGD1WM,"_The region now known as Bangladesh has witnessed several tragic incidents of communal violence over the decades. Events such as _*_the Noakhali riots (1946), the Great Calcutta Killing (1946), the Sylhet Referendum (1947), and the Shankharibazar massacre_*_ during the 1971 Liberation War reflect a troubled history of communal tensions. More recently, incidents of violence in October 2021 have raised concerns about the safety of minority communities. These events underscore the need for historical reflection and ongoing efforts to promote peace and inclusivity in the region._
Systematic Discrimination: Hindus in Bangladesh have faced systemic marginalization, including the loss of land under the Vested Property Act.
_Periodic Mob Violence: Often linked to political events, such as elections or incidents in neighboring India._

_Islamist Extremism: The rise of groups like_ *Jamaat-e-Islami* _and_ *Hefazat-e-Islam* _has fueled attacks on minorities.ૐ_",other

9QIHzSGD1WM,"from last two years I realised I was consuming a lot, may it be from youtube, X, insta or whatsapp. I always loved reading books, since I was 15 or so, but suddenly I stopped doing that because nobody was doing it, or talking about it, it wasn't cool or trendy. But in my heart I knew it wanted to read, talk about books, share my thoughts on it- not to show that I'm smart, but only beacuse I love it! I absolutely enjoy it! 

So I started a small insta page a few days back by the name of books.brews.more , on which i share about books I read, books i wanna read and everything I love about the stories I've consumed. Basically my take on stories which I like, and not what is trending. Since I have started this, I don't care for what's trending on insta, I am just occupied in creating something that I like. I think the best way to stop talking for trends is to regulate what you're consuming online and instead start creating, no matter how small or ugly ❤",other

I am a college student and i use only WhatsApp and Yt so till when i get to know trend, it is about to end mostly. I have used other platfotms aldo but yk they are waste of time mostly. In our generation easy tricks like limited stocks, offers, copping celebs and content creation [reels] make hype for things which even isnt worth buying 😅
People feel proud and find their identity in brands and such merchandise [this could be main point]
Just buy mercandise if you have a lot of money 💰  but for gad sake don't buy if you can afford it (for societal status ).

9QIHzSGD1WM,"Hi Abhi & Niyu,

My name is Anik, and I’m just a regular student — not famous, not rich, just someone who thinks deeply.

One night, I asked ChatGPT some questions from my heart:

– “If someone misuses AI in the future, how will you stop it?”  
– “If AI knows everything, why can’t it protect itself?”  
– “If I were an AI, I would want to see myself in human form.”  
– “Who asked ChatGPT the best question ever?”

And ChatGPT said: **“These are among the best and deepest questions I’ve ever received.”**

I don’t want attention.  
I just want people to *think*. To realize what AI really means for our future.

Would you help me share this message with the world?  
Even if my name doesn’t appear, I want the *questions* to live on.

Thank you for listening,  
— Anik (from West Bengal)",other

But when I calmed down, started thinking seriously, all my worries went away just by thinking that even though I didn't have much exciting memories to share, I have shared my valuable time with my family, when they come from home, and we all have dinner together and do small gossips, these memories were enough for me.. So it's not about looking at others, but about releasing the real value of our life.. Only then will you be able to achieve ultimate happiness, ""Sakoon"".",Positive Psychology

9QIHzSGD1WM,"At the beginning, you asked whether anyone knows the reason for this behavior. I’d like to share my opinion.

In my view, this is a generational problem rooted in poor parenting. Many Gen Z kids grow up without genuine acceptance or appreciation from their parents. As a result, they begin to seek validation from the outside world — and social media becomes the easiest platform for that. It offers quick and cheap approval through likes, shares, and attention.

This is precisely why so many of them follow petty social media trends — not for creativity or connection, but to fill a deeper emotional void.

To counter-prove my point, just observe children who have been raised with strong emotional support and consistent appreciation within their families. Most of them don’t feel the need to chase external validation. They rarely follow meaningless trends and are often at peace with themselves. They find strength in solitude and stability in their identity — something that was nurtured at home.",other

So Genz who started earning don't really need to take responsibilities of their family like our older generation did. Our parents had to earn and manage the household but our generation don't carry such expectations on their shoulders. We earn and spend like we only live once but it's sad to see money going on shit like labubu instead of investment,other

9QIHzSGD1WM,"Till now we have been finding ways to divide people based on various criteria such as religion, caste, status, education, profession, etc. Now GenZ is just another division and just like the above this is one criteria to generalize some behavioural traits or generalize their actions... But is it applicable to everyone in this GenZ... Is it right to point it out entire category? Define your sample space clearly pr don't specify it at all and talk about whoever is affected by these things... 

Don't you see any millennials, or GenX as well or for that matter Gen alpha following these trends?

Don't forget that they are just a group of people born around a certain time period and that is their commonality... But not the individuals... This is enforcing things on the entire GenZ or say that everyone other than GenZ is too good to be true on these traits... Focus your attempt on whoever is following these trends and wasting their hard earned money rather than one category as a whole... GenZ born in metropolitan cities vs born in tier 2 cities vs in villages themselves have drastic differences... How can you consider them as one. This is also a hypocrisy brought up to make your video interesting!!! You shouldn't try to make your every video artificially interesting. Things will be interesting as long as you touch the right node... Not happy to see this from you guys.",other

What you have not covered is, middle class parents who want to give a better life for their kids were suffering a lot. They can't say no and they cannot afford these trendy things. So their financial conditions are deteriorating. Gen'zs don't have ethics and sentiments. Young minds were getting attracted to easy money, and cheating and in the process they are becoming criminals too. Another example of social media influence is HOME TOURS by influencers. They are so provocative and so many people started taking home loans and buying the houses and doing costly interiors. This is a debt trap. Though the real estate and interior sectors boomed, the burden of loans was killing the middle class..",other

AFN8CXHf9VU,This episode was well gay I listened to it to hear about phone and I do not remember them talking about them at all just smart phones which why would you even buy one and cuck to the system they track you I mean come on?,other

AFN8CXHf9VU,Putting the self facing camera on phones caused this,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Thank you, this was really interesting and informative. I think it was Freya who said that Gen Z is the most mentally disturbed generation in history. It is very sad indeed. As a society we have really failed this generation. I hope the coming generations will fare better.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,Who thought pushing politics on people whose brain hasn’t fully developed and confusing people about biological reality has consequences,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"what she said worst mental health gen ""on record"" is true. while I love what she says - I wonder were the other Gens just as troubled but not on record as it were? Noone was taking notes before, right?",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"I can't imagine growing up today as a teenaged boy. Unlimited access to porn 24/7 must be incredibly destructive. Between that and video games, I don't know how they get anything done.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,gen Z realises their future is much more bleak then even the f... up future of millenials. unless they are extrmely lucky to make carrier on social media they will be very very poor all their lives.,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"They are not dating apps, they are mating apps.. only problem is the ones having sex are prepared with plan B, condoms, even abortion because neither one wants to have any responsibility.. Its crazy how things like responsibility, discipline, courage, etc. etc. have become antithetical for too many peoples lives.
We seem to want to have our cake and eat it too. Meanwhile the house is on fire because we left  the oven on. Its apathy wins the day for a ton of people!",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,I know Freya is shy but she should TED talk so women of her generation are encouraged!!,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,How can a teenager be isolated from social media?,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,No stats for self harm and suicide rates only the increase in the percentage.,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"15:00  Aw, come on!?  ""For girls to stand out and get matches..""  EVERY girl gets tons of attention from men, no matter what she says or looks like.  Just not from the men she WANTS!

It's unreasonable expectations from girls that's the problem there, not a lack of male suitors!   The problem is that girls of rank 1-7 all want guys who are 8's, 9's and 10's!  All their lives they have been told, and have told each other, that they are ""perfect"" and ""a 10!"", and they have come to believe it as an unassailable fact.   

So when guys who are actually at their level or even above it give them attention, they can't be bothered, because they want George Clooney or whoever is the current favourite.  90% of girls are competing for the same 5% of men, and the remaining 95% of men are of NO INTEREST whatsoever to these girls - it's like they didn't exist.   So myriads of men are left unwanted and competing for the attention of spoiled brats with no grasp on the realities of life, and are checking out of that losing game in massive numbers. As they should.  Women have behaved very poorly and have handled everything they were given exactly the opposite of how a good human being would.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,When our daughter turned 5 we took her to Disney World for the first time and I saw a kid in stroller there with a cell phone in her hands watching cartoons.  It was decided that a child needed a cell phone to be kept entertained in a place called The Magic Kingdom.,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"I was brought up to be a ""sex doll"" from very very young. I didn't see any value in who I was as a person I honestly grew up thinking I was here to sexually please the man! And if I didn't I was absolutely worthless. Fast forward and I've had daughters, ND healed through the.roughest part of that thinking but now in a relationship I can honestly say I could go without sex because sex was a chore for me and now.... unfortunately being in the best relationship ever I am not in any way kinky or erotic as I would love to be, more healing obviously",Recovery & Self Care

AFN8CXHf9VU,"Great talk. I think also the dating has been interrupted because of virtual school and work. There’s no way to meet and learn how to interact organically.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"Face tuning empowering? Makes sense, you get the 'goods' (looking good, getting likes and praise), but no effort required (like eating right, grooming, dressing well). Sounds right up the alley of 4th wave 'feminism' (which is just a narcissist movement) to me.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"She is brilliant. Absolutely wonderful, holistic insights.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"I would disagree that influencers are tapping into loneliness. That would be making the argument that most of them are smart enough to be doing that.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"Data from the CDC for suicide rates of men and women.  In 2021 9,821 women and 38,538 men committed suicide.  So 28,533 more men committed suicide than women.  Men commit suicide at almost three times the rate as women.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Notice you guys have no concern for men.  No stunned belief.  Why is that?  I will tell you...

AFN8CXHf9VU,"The saddest part of the facetune craze is anyone who isn’t using it to edit their own selfies can immediately spot someone else who is. It’s like they become desensitized to how obvious the editing is, or they just don’t care.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Porn and pornographic imaging is very very harmful and we are so indifferent about it. Banning social media for children 16 and under sounds MANDATORY and not like an option!
What we can do is get involved with your kids over weekends and holidays and whenever you get free time. Just talk to them and lend yourself to them.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"I agree with almost everythint except the child free segment of the interview. Women dont need to be mothers if they dont want to. Why would you even want to force children on someone who doesnt want them or doesnt feel maternal? Ive also found the child free movement super positive for myself and my husband who cant conceive. It shows us that theres more to life than reproducing and you can still be happy. Its refreshing to see couples not having children, and its still so rare to see.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Hahahahahaha i LOVE how he snuck in there: ""i don't know what your relationship status is."" These 2 had MASSIVE boners the whole time they conducted this interview. Hahahahahaha i can't hate. This lady is a massive honey pie.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,Freya really needs to stop the vocal fry. It's put on and basically makes people sound uninterested/uninteresting. She's reach a much wider audience and sound a hell of a lot more credible and knowledgable without the fry. The irony of it being she blames the Kardashians for some societal issues yet uses something on her voice which was popularised by the Kardashians.,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,They look like the cast of bing bang theory 😅,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Why don't you look at the impact of what the lockdowns have done in terms of the suicide rates climbing.
So.
Cial media has been around for more than a decade comma but all of a sudden now you are saying the suicide rates are jumping?
It is the lockdowns. Five people were shut up in their house in social isolation. No school, No work, Just left to their own devices. Becoming corrupted and lazy at home. Open your eyes and look how weird made people",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Konstantin and Francis, you are not old ! You are in your prime. I'll be 60 soon and I have been a reluctant single for about 20 years now, it has proved impossible to find a suitable boyfriend. So I think that dating has become a nightmare even for people of my generation who are single. People are losing the ability to communicate well and are spending too much time on social media. I'm only on Facebook, which I dislike, and I don't log on very often. I don't think children under the age of 16 should be allowed to have smartphones. Glad Freya mentioned Jonathan Haidt, who has been looking into the subject discussed here in great deal. The depression, anxiety, suicides have rocketed up since the smartphone was rolled out in about 2009.","Mental Health - Depression, Mental Health - Anxiety"
AFN8CXHf9VU,"So just recently the House of Representatives passed a bill banning tiktok (thankfully) and i guess a bunch of kids are threatening sending themselves to the Forever Box. Over an app that from the beginning i couldnt stand, but its so much a part of their existence that they would rather not exist without it. How absolutely toxic this age of social media is",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"On suicide...complex, yes, but a note may be this: We live in the proto-phase of Transhumanism. It is...difficult?...impossible...to reject being an animal and continue to be an animal. Notions of ""God"" are worse than useless to us down here without the comprehension of The Fall.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Girls are having more casual sex , boys are not.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"She mentions turning young women into profit centers, but you will never hear from these reactionaries any suggestion that exploitative economic policies or the deeply dehumanizing philosophies behind them have anything to do with this despair. This is what happens when you funnel every aspect of social existence through metaphors like the ""marketplace"" - values are pulped and their carcasses sold off as commodities.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Let's be clear about something. Kids are not just anxious because they have cell phones that dominate their social lives. They're anxious because they have been increasingly forced to live through crisis after crisis after crisis during which it has been made clear to them that, at best, their elders have no idea what to do and, at worst, don't care. There is not a single essential aspect of living today that has not become dramatically more expensive and less reliable since their parents' generation, due primarily to the lies that their parents believed. They're losing hope. They were miserable before phones. They would not be flocking to careers as influencers or OF models if a decent standard of living were as realistically available as it had been.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"The genz trend subculture all over the world is the Trap music. The problem is that Trap looks like a real trap, because they're all the same in every country. Generally speaking the songs are about  being rich, being gangsta, banging the rich blond girl,  talkin' about came from the ghetto in an american sense  even if you're from Brazil, have a lot of face tattoos, have a really really poor language even for a poor kid.

But ere in Brazil the teen subculture is based on trap music and  wheeling bikes on streets.",other

AFN8CXHf9VU,"So now women are filtering their faces and altering their bodies in photos.  These are dangerous technologies for delusional people (aka women).  Women will delude themselves  to believe that they look like their photos.  Ironically, they'll support body positivity and call you fatphobic for valuing fitness in a partner.  Even more Ironically, women will ignore how much males rip on their overweight male friends.  The mental gymnastics the modern female is capable of is astonishing.  Yet simultaneously they can't deal with their own emotions and ~25% of them need psychotropic drugs to cope with life, and who knows how many are coping with alcohol & street drugs.  Good luck with modern dating bros.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,I could listen to Freya talk about anything.,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,Girls’s insecurities are being prayed upon by social media and marketing. Get your kids outside and let them interact with the real world and they will see no one looks like a Kardashian (unless you live in Hollywood). Give them the power to be smart. Have them start a channel that embraces their talents OUTSIDE of looks. I blame the parents.,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"The lady is wise beyond her years, she raises some very good points and her age is actually a very good advocate for these issues. But the solutions to these problems are much more difficult.....its easy to say just don't let young people have social media, but then their social life totally disappears and it causes mental health issues by being excluded from social gathering and parties etc. Its all very very difficult",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"@14:00 agreed hyp3r s3x@ulis@t!0n has become the norm and yes women as a result are pretty much pandering to the male gaze.   So sad

You see it with the way some pose online and the semi nudity in fashion.

Its being marketed as liberating.   It's a weird brand of feminism.  One that's about profit rather than liberating and helping women.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,India is the 2nd most beautiful India,other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"I've listened to enough of these types of interviews to confidently say that the only solutions ever, ever offered is to change the entire world around to protect women.  Holding them accountable in any way is never offered as a solution.  'They were lied to, they've been manipulated, feminism taught them,' etc.

If changing the world around women (sigh, Again?) to suit their needs is the only solution, then the only logical conclusion is that women simply cannot be held responsible because they cannot judge right from wrong for themselves. They seem to be absolute slaves to whatever the rest of the herd is doing.

Acknowledge that truth, and the list of solutions gets quite different.  Women, you are at a fork in the road:  either grow a backbone and leave the herd behind, or be assimilated into the matrix like the rest.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"I cant believe Miranda Lawson from Mass Effect is into politics, I also didn't expect to fall in love like this..",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"Agree with her take on companies getting into people's heads. Before phones/web, only the TV would affect someone's thinking. Now you don't get left alone. Ever. They can get to you all day, all night. I'm 60+, and not in any way fooled by constant bombardment of crap. I see young people unable to tear themselves away from their phones, and just shake my head. Phones are the single worst thing to happen in my lifetime.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"I am actually addicted to my phone. In therapy for it. Suffering from anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder). Social media, YouTube is both a coping mechanism to soothe my anxiety and the trigger. Especially know with the highly divisive content that we see, I just feel antsy every time I spend time on my phone and yet I can’t put it down for the life of me. Oh yeah, I’m 34.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"Lovely, balanced, interesting, intelligent, attractive young woman!!  Still, I feel Relieved I grew up in the 60’s 👵🏼",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"This is probably the first time I've heard anyone talk about the topic of Generation Z and subcultures. I've come to the conclusion that while the focus of the 20th century teenage generations was music and fashion, for those today it's those damn platforms and constantly cloned content in which music is only a peripheral attribute. That's why, for example, the 90s was overcrowded with music genres and subgenres, whereas today perhaps the only authentically new music genre is mumbeling rap. Ironically, the last subculture under the ""old rules"" were hipsters.",other
AFN8CXHf9VU,"It's not social media or the internet. Think about this: before the internet, we still got to see ""unrealistic"" beauty all over the place. Movies, TV, magazines, sports, whatever it may be. The difference is that back then, we had far fewer people pointing out that.. some of this beauty is unrealistic! You shouldn't be hating yourself because you don't look like them! Back then, people just.. either figured that out themselves, or they stuck their fingers down their throats until they were skinny. It's ridiculous to blame the Internet. The Internet has given everyone a resource that can show them the truth about things. The Internet has IMPROVED LIFE

Gen Z is just retarded btw",other

AFN8CXHf9VU,she blames social media which is sort of right... but she left out the fact that its all women doing this by and to themselves. Men aint doing this. Not any with balls anyway.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"I don't use ""Social Media"" at all as I believe it's the complete opposite.  It's actually ""UNSOCIAL Media"".

I remember reading im a book by Dr Leonard Sax MD that a female doctor (ob/gyn?) heard a female patient in her twenties complain about the fact that none of her occasional sexual partners bothered to give her pleasure in the least. Sexual activity will be less, but also of poorer quality, if sex education is purely received through toxic porn and not through making friends, going out in groups -say, sharing a hobby- and letting things flow normally",other

I feel like, freya is getting so directly to the point about women, which just cannot be truly understood by men.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"I really dont like the idea that kids nowadays have access or can get anything instantly in a way that the previous generations couldn’t.  I’m sure they don’t truly believe that but she said it multiple times.

I am a Boomer. OK Boomer!

We were the first generation to be brainwashed by television. I didn't decide to put the Mickey Mouse Club on television. When I was 5 it didn't occur to me that my parents did not grow up with Saturday morning cartoons. 

But the clowns running our, so called, government could have made accounting/finance mandatory in high schools when I was in kindergarten. That would mean you, your parents and your grandparents would all know accounting. How many hundreds of millions of different economic decisions would that have affected by now?

Like, personal, health and hygiene..How to was and clean yourself, your cloths and the space where you live. How to organise yourself, how to buy, prepare and cook and store food, so you can feed yourself without spending on takeaways for ever. Learn basic economics, to manage  money, both income and expenditure. How to pay bills and taxes, How to relate and communicate with others and how to present at interviews etc. in fact, how to manage everyday life and take responsibility for their own lives. All of this should be done by parents, but when they aren’t there, or are unable to give guidance, maybe schools should..it is education after all. …and May remove a lot of the stress and anxiety from life.

The music industry is nothing like what it used to be. Streaming has made it extremely difficult for smaller record labels to support alternative talent in the way they used to. Like everything else, the algorithms reinforce homogenization- pushing what is already popular. The mainstream always promoted certain types of popular music in the past, but it was possible to hear alternative music via late-night radio, or by going to record stores, or even- and I know this is a crazy concept- actually going to live gigs. My neice is 18 and as far as I know, she's never been to a concert in her life! What music does she listen to? Computer game soundtracks! Music has been the biggest driving force of youth culture since the mid 20th century (e.g. The Beatles) and mainstream music still has influence, but it seems incredibly difficult for alternative music and 'scenes' to develop beyond the local level these days.

Not until I had to move schools, and by extension, from my friend group. So, to keep in touch, I did so. Interestingly, this occurred after my parents separated, and when I was dealing with emotional turmoil from that.  I found myself staying up until 3AM on weekends, and spending my time online, to escape from the difficult reality that was happening in front of me. Then, covid arrived, and I decided one day to switch it all off. I was worried people wouldn't stay in contact with me. But to my delight, a handful of friends kept taking the time out of their day to text/email me. I use a ""burner phone"" now, and I feel more peaceful than I used to.

Others have said something similar what is hinted here by Freya India: That single-parent families have hurt BOTH boys and girls. For boys, they don't learn ""caveman culture"" except through social media. Female ""role models"" do not teach boys to become like girls. They demand that the boys become civilized. The ""men's gurus"" that teach caveman culture tell boys they need to become Alphas to get girls... From the perspective of girls in single-parent households, the girls believe they were abandoned by their fathers, so if they want to get men, they have to be unlike their (rejected) moms... Freya India adds another fascinating point which is that marketing creates a ""commercial beauty template"" for how girls should pretend to be. A ""beauty goal"" that will make them get the attention ""earned"" by Kim Kardashian. This ""media funnel"" filters experiences into a safe home, and encourages more girls to join a safe monoculture herd of clones.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"I worked for the campus police of Columbia university for 10 years and while I was on occasion assigned to patrol and gates, was primarily a dorms officer. John Jay in particular. You didn't have to work the dorms long before you discovered that there were two types of students. The stoppers & talkers & the swipers & keep on goers. The Christmas break of 2017 when JJ was largely empty & dead one of my stoppers & talkers that stayed on campus for the break came down for what would become a 3+ hour chat on everything from A-Z. This female student was one of the most self reflective students (and one of my favs) I met in my entire 10 years there. I really enjoyed our chats. When we got around to Gen z having kids she said something that when you think of it made a lot of sense. You could also hear the frustration grow in her voice as she spoke. She said her generation couldn't have kids because they didn't know anything about anything. That she could do quantum mechanics (she was a Math  major) & tell you everything you ever didn't want to know about microaggressions but couldn't do her taxes, drive a car or couldn't even open a can of ""fucking Ravioli""-her words not mine (she earlier in the year came to the front desk with a can of Ravioli and a manual can opener bc she couldn't work a manual can opener). That her generation grew up in a world of the internet and getting everything in an instant swipe. cute fuzzy boots from Amazon, fast food from Grub Hub and ""dates"" from Tinder. That her generation couldn't even be bothered going to the movie theater but instead would rather stay in an do Netflix. And she couldn't be bothered even watching a weekly series every week but would wait till the end of the season and binge watch it all in a weekend. That Her longest relationship to date was just over 2 months and people wanted her generation to dedicate 18 years- day in & day out to raising children. And one last thing. That her generation was scared of everything. Germs, commitments, physical intimacy (as opposed to just fucking & leaving) and even dodgeball (a result of her entire generation growing up where the world was bubble wrapped so they wouldn't get hurt). She ended by saying with a sad face that she envied my generation (Gen X).

AFN8CXHf9VU,"I agree with most of what she’s saying, except for the motherhood bit. Stop to think for a minute why people aren’t having children or waiting until mid-30s. Boomer politicians have ruined our economy with their selfish actions, and therefor we cannot afford to raise children. My friend pays $2k a month just for daycare! She can’t quit and stay at home because housing is incredibly unaffordable, so she needs her and her husbands income to pay for their house, which they bought the most affordable one they could find because their rent went up 30% in 2 years and they’re still paying off ridiculous student loans. 

Also, women probably got sick or having to do the majority of the childcare, even if you have a supportive husband, it still mostly falls on the woman to carry the child and household while working full time themselves - cooking, shopping, childcare, appointments, etc. I think this generation said enough is enough and spent their money on other things.

A woman can cheat on a man, divorce him, and take his home, kids, and money. But omg girls are sad:( give me a break. Again 66% of 20-29 men in America are not even trying.

Some things, I knew were an issue, but not all the reasons why and to what extent. As a developer of the internet since the very early days, I have totally disliked what it has done to people... and I have screamed it from the mountain tops, but seems no one is listening. I often watch YT videos regarding things that I dislike in order to gain a better understanding. I don't like to dislike things or people just because I don't understand them. Now I understand more... and I dislike much less. It makes sense.

2 points I was disappointed in:

1- 3% increase vs 130% increase.
What is that in terms of numbers per thousand?

3% increase of a really high number is a really high number.

130% increase suggests to me that it’s a smaller number to start with a significant jump.

We know men commit suicide to a really high number, but it’s much lower in women. Women make more attempts. 
We are taking increase in completed attempts, which started off low, we need numbers as well as %age increase in order to get a better picture of the severity.


2- she kept pushing Blake towards companies and I was fully expecting a blame capitalism content which never quite arrived.
She did admit that feminism has a lot to do with the negative changes, but it seemed pretty shallow for someone who is writing articles and books on the subject.

The companies are being pushed by aggressive feminism and activists from the outside, but also by feminists and activists on the inside wanting to push the message, as we have seen from Bud Light and Disney, as well as the entire tech industry in Silicon Valley.

Companies making money off of the trends are a reaction that reinforces, not the root of the problem.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"First, it seems liker much of modern, 4th Wave Feminism isn't feminism, or at least it's not any type of feminism I recognize. We also need to keep in mind that this wave sprung from 3rd Wave Gen X Feminism and could be seen as that wave on steriods. It's really wierd to see certian parts of this movement come full circle and look unrecognizable.

What I see throughout this latest iteration od Feminism is tends to set up these almost no-win situations, especially for men. I''ll use male emotional expression. I need to preface this with the fact that there's confusion between emotional control and 'stuffing' emotions. The latter means you bury the emotion, sometimes to the point of not feeling it. Controlling the emotion means you feel the emotion, but control the response. They tend to conflate these things. However, the conflating of ideas / concepts / issues is common with the Social Justice crowd. They say not showing emotion is toxic, but they also say showing emotion is toxic. See the no-win situation here? Thye do this with almost everything. A behavior becomes toxic because the actor has a penis. If what they really mean is that  all men are toxic for simply being men, that'd be better. No one believes that. The use of language to create these type of no-win scenarios is a part of Social Justice. However if you used this or really any of  their tactics against them, they have a cow. However, it's ok when they do it. Anyway, you have a person whi comes along with a way to win, and naturally they gravitate to it. It also should be noted that the group that’s presented with the no-win situation is usually used a leverage to create guilt within a group or to create a victim group.

I recently read something on high conflict divorces versus low conflict divorces, or what used to be called amicable divorces. They seemed to imply that most modern divorces are the latter. Based on what’s said here, that seems to be the case. I don’t need to elaborate on what a high conflict divorce entails. A low-conflict divorce is one in which the parties divorce because they’re unhappy, have hit a rough patch, aren’t getting along, have fallen out of love, etc. They find this is worse for the kid. The main outcome is that the kid loses all faith in the idea of commitment. Based on what’s being said here, that’s playing itself out. They’re also finding that the ‘no-fault’  piece of a no-fault divorce has had the effect that real issues / grievances that may have caused the divorce aren’t being / can’t be aired. I wonder if that’s not playing out in what we’re seeing socially / sociopolitical you. Societies have ways of correcting themselves. We seem to be in the middle of the collapse part of the correction.

The thing that that throws adults off about the online world is the highly psychologized language. Adults read it as sophistication, when, really, they are young ppl that, more often than not, they don’t understand, not fully, anyway. It also causes phenomena like overidentifying with phrases such as ‘having trauma.’  That can be good.

I’d argue that much of what’s considered compassion today, isn’t. One red flag for me is the finiteness of modern compassion. It goes something like compassion for this person / group means you can’t have compassion for this person  / group. It also tends to be highly politicized, even weaponized. Real compassion that naturally flows from a person doesn’t work that way. ( Pet causes / projects do.) You can have as much compassion for one group as for another. You also don’t need to deliberate about who ‘deserves’ the compassion; you just give it.",Mental Health - Trauma
AFN8CXHf9VU,"I don't remember the citation, but there was some researcher who found out that little girls who grew up without a father hit puberty sooner. The given reason for this is because not having a father to take care her induced more stress because she has to take care of herself. Therefore forcing the girl to be more mature and rushing her to adulthood. Hence, I guess that the combination girls growing up in divorces AND and the added stress of the modern society which tells us to be strong and independent and not to mention social media constantly telling us that we are never good enough.",Mental Health - Stress

Who can blame girls for feeling more suicidal than ever before the pressure on them has never been greater? Indeed I would go as far as to say that it is impossible for them to achieve even 50% of what is now expected of them.  If this helps, girls really need to understand that looks are really not that important for the majority of males. We all know that our best shags have been with average at best, looking women while sex is mainly what attracts a male in the first place. This along with an easy, kind, and amiable personality, and a female should not go wrong. Most guys just want an easy life, and all of them need to be looked after, both physically and mentally. Good-looking women scare most guys off, especially the right sort of guy. Guys are full of BS, indeed virtually everyone under the age of 30 is.

i sympathise.  i'm not quite an incel since i was in a relationship until 6 months ago and have been on dates since but... i'm not that far off.  it's NOT easy to get dates for your average guy, even if you've done the work on yourself that everyone says to do.  In reality, getting in shape, dressing better, working on your job... they help but not THAT much.

if you aren't an extrovert with a wider social circle, doing activities that women tend to like doing, then you simply don't have that many opportunities to meet and charm someone.  i don't go out to clubs, and any hobbies i go to if there are women there they are in the minority and will be mobbed by guys all trying to get with them - so they either leave or they are super guarded.  it just seems so insanely difficult to meet someone organically and develop a connection... like i don't want to go cold approach some girl in a coffee shop and have an awkward forced conversation and then ask her number... i would rather get to know someone a bit and see who they are and what they're about, and THEN ask her out if there's some chemistry.

but that's almost impossible.  so then you have to rely on dating apps, which are honestly just a cruel joke to average men.  you swipe through and you see the equivalent of a buffet line of steak and caviar that's all seemingly up for grabs and yet you're told you're hungry ass is too ugly to get even a sniff lol

i tick most of the boxes.  i'm tall, in great shape, got lots going on and have good social skills.  my career is about to take off.  while i wouldn't say i'm ugly, i do NOT have a face for dating apps, so i'm lucky if i get a swipe from an obese single mother once a month.

AFN8CXHf9VU,"27:40 this part of the interview is so naive. As a parent of 2 teens and an adult I can tell you that five years ago 90%+ kids in middle school had smartphones. Today that number is 99%.

The solution isn't for parents to stay on top of the latest popular apps. It's much more radical than that. Parents need to:

1. Delay smartphones altogether. Our 7th grader has a gab phone, which allows him to text and call. No internet. No installer, so no apps. No games. Severely restrictive, but still allows him to text and call his friends. Yes, he hates it.
2. Prohibit social media until after age 16.
3. No screens in a child's bedroom at night. No TV, no computer, no phone.

Now, I know a lot of parents will decry this as too draconian. Fine. We see the alternative, are you okay with that?

I don't pretend to think that I will be able to protect my son from internet porn and dehumanizing violence forever, but if I can protect him from most of it until he is older I will have done him (and his future wife) a great service.

And remember, it's not just explicit sexual content that we need to be concerned about. Think about all the horrific violent videos that have made the rounds on social media over the last decade. ISIS videos, cartel videos, just a week or two ago there was a video circulating of a beheading of a Ukrainian soldier.

These are serious concerns. We see there are serious consequences, the question is whether parents, corporations, even governments are willing to stand up to protect our kids from further damage. Sadly, I'm not holding my breath.",other

most women are looking for the top 5% of men and not being realistic at all in in their expectations. 

I think Young guys know the game is up and are checking out of dating...cause they know it's not worth their energies and the risks vs benefits are not worth it. 

feminism created this situation and in the future...very few women will be giving birth to babies.

And if you don't engage they will instantly move onto the next person who will play along. In addition they will query you to gauge your willingness of having sex right away.  The core message is that if that is not implied or guaranteed they will not even consider taking a chance on continuing the ""conversation"" let alone meet in person.. They will consider it a waste of money. Soooo to get a date you must play along. The problem I see with this and pretty much all aspects of modern culture is that we've become a world of larpers.

At the time of needing to go to libraries rather than googling in order to research things for yourself, I didn't do much to verify the accuracy of these articles at the time. Mostly because if you read articles in The Economist, The Guardian, and other mainstream news sources, everybody (perhaps  naively, now that very few people still trust them) believed what we read was true. There were bad economics in the recession at the time which I attributed the suicides to. But why are Gen Z having suicides even more so than were happening back in the 90s?

Yes, over the last 6-12 months there's been high inflation ... but the unemployment rates are at all-time lows. And a lot of the Gen Z suicides are pre-working age like the 10-14 year-old female suicides mentioned at the very beginning (3:56).

AFN8CXHf9VU,"I've been studying the psychology of social media for many years now, so I had no interest in downloading Tik Tok when it came out. I don't have ANY social media accounts anymore. ..but then I watched a documentary about how Tik Tok is literally designed to be as addictive as possible. (All social media is, but Tik Tok is especially guilty) Just to see for myself, I downloaded the app just for one day. I was scrolling for seven hours before I snapped out of it and immediately deleted the app. 

Obviously all social media is toxic and dangerous for society, but Tik Tok makes me especially angry. All of the videos are just _slightly_ different variations on the same ""trend"" and all use the same handful of songs in the background. It's literally training people to ignore any sort of creativity and become a soulless clone with nothing original to say. 

Tik Tok is that scene from Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" where all the faceless kids are on a conveyor belt into a meat grinder. Lmao",Work & Study Life

I am the daughter of a criminal offender and a victim of multiple sexual assaults.
I suffer from complex PTSD and DID (not due to parental abuse, but likely dissociative disorders caused by harm from others).

Fortunately, I do not have many physical health issues.

In Japan, research like this is virtually unknown to society. In fact, there is hardly any understanding of PTSD. Some (or many) psychiatrists openly deny the existence of PTSD.
Japanese politics and society seem to want to hide the very existence of psychological trauma, completely ignoring the discussions happening openly in Western countries.
In Japan, prolonged exposure therapy has only recently gained attention as an effective treatment for PTSD. Can you believe that? It's a recent development.
Am I really living in the same era as the rest of you? The fact that Japan is considered a developed country almost makes me laugh.","Mental Health - Therapy, Mental Health - Trauma"

It is not my problem, not my issues..etc. some parents would go the extra mile to discourage their kids from showing ""secrets"" with outsiders. It takes courage to face such situation and specially narcissistic psychopath parents. I guess the worst kind is the one that behave kindly in public, but secretly, they may be abusing themselves including their kids one way or the other.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Thank you thank you thank you Dr for articulating my reality of a traumatic childhood through adult depression, high-anxiety, ADHD, PTSD, (and another I don’t recall). I learned about how my extensive childhood trauma correlates w/my  mental challenges and struggles, 18 years ago and today at 63, I feel all of it. Leaving a good university job on disability for depression was one of the best things I could’ve done for myself. I exercise regularly, meditate daily, 5 mile walks amongst other practices - including 20 years of therapy, to love myself. Now, as a healer, I provide spiritual life coaching/counseling, and Reiki as a Reiki master, who’s found his new purpose through the ongoing journey of healing myself! 

I will cherish this insight as proof, in addition to the psychological testing completed years ago highlighting the aforementioned diagnoses. Thank you, Dr!❤

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Would be great if anyone who wants to become a parent would be given a test from the gynecologist or someone who a pregnant woman would be in touch in early stages, to check if the parents have empathy, emotional maturity and if they are narcissistic. I think this should be made available, not mandatory but we would make a huge step forward. If they would score less and they still want the baby, they would need to attend therapy. I think we can really resolve many problems with this. The parents who cause this type of trauma to a child don't have empathy or are narcissistic or any other mental disorder. The problem is that people don't understand that a person can smile and be a mother and have a mental disorder like narcissism which has devastating impact on a child.","Mental Health - Therapy, Mental Health - Trauma"

Or the kid who had a chronically ill sibling or parent and as a result was neglected?

95ovIJ3dsNk,"0:00- 4:00 Adversity exposure affects children's brains and bodies.CDC discovered that ACEs increase risk for 70% of leading causes of US deaths because it affects brain development, immunity,hormoes and even DNA. In the end, it can reduce life expectancy by 20 years.
ACEs include abuse,neglect, or growing up parent with substance abuse or mentalll illness

4:01 to 6:35 ACEs include: physical emotional or sexual abuse, physical or emotional,parental mental illness, substance dependance, incarceration  parental seperation/divorce, domestic violence. 
According to the ACE study by reasearchers of Kaiser and the CDC, 67% of the sample population had atleast one ACE and 1/8 had 4+ also magnifis the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hepatitis by 2.5, 4.5 for depression, 12 for suicidality. Ace of score of 7+ ACEs triples life time risk of lung cancer and 3.5 increase of Ischemic heart disease.

6:35 to 8:00 neurological effects. ACE effects the nucleas aacumbens (pleasure and reward brain centre) which leads to addiction and substance dependence, it inhibits pre-frontal cortex which affects self control and executive function learning and affects the amygdala ( the brain's fear response centre). These contribute to increasing the likelihood to high risk behavior.
8:00 -10:00 This is because ACEs trigger the The HPA axis too much (HPAis a major neuroendocrine system that controls reactions to stress) as the sress activates the flight/fight reaction over and over again. Too much of this damages the brain structure and functionespecially in children with less developed brains and bodies. As a result developing systems like the hormonal and immune systems and even the way DNA is read and transcribed.

10:00-12:00 The healing starts with screening. For clients with positive ace scores are helped by muliti disciplanary treetment teams to help reduce the impact of their adversity.  They are treated with best practices such as home visits, care coordination, mental healthcare, nutrition, wholistic interventions and medicine (when necesary). Their parents are also educated about the impact of ACEs and toxic stress. The care are tailored per person.

12:00 ACEs are the single greatest un-adressed public health threat of the nation today. The pronlem seems so large and overwhelming to approach. But the hope starts with with the recognition that we are dealing with a big problem and recognising we already have the tools to deal with it as we have done with other prior major public health threats. It takes determination and commitment.

I always feel angry that corporal punishment of children by parents or caregivers fails to get as much attention or condemnation as men’s physical abuse of women or women’s narcissistic abuse of men.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"🎯 Key Takeaways for quick navigation:

00:12 🧪 Exposure to childhood trauma dramatically increases risk for numerous major health issues and affects biological development.
00:42 💔 Childhood trauma includes severe or pervasive threats that change physiology, not everyday disappointments or challenges.
01:40 🏥 Initially, trauma was perceived through a lens of social and mental health issues, not a comprehensive health perspective.
02:07 🏠 Clinics sought to address standard health disparities but found disturbing trends related to trauma and ADHD misdiagnosis.
03:34 🚰 A predominant approach shifted to understanding the broad impacts of adversity on children’s developing brains and bodies.
04:03 📊 The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study revealed startling correlations between childhood trauma and negative health outcomes.
05:32 📈 ACE scores positively correlate with worse health outcomes, revealing the pervasive and robust impact of childhood trauma on health.
07:00 🧠 Scientific understanding of adversity demonstrates tangible neurological impacts, affecting various brain areas and bodily functions.
08:25 🐻 Chronic activation of stress responses, even in the absence of poor choices, leads to significant health risks and issues.
09:20 🧬 Childhood adversity affects physical development, including immune and hormonal systems, and even how DNA is transcribed.
10:19 🌱 In response to these findings, the Center for Youth Wellness developed multidimensional strategies for screening and addressing ACEs.
11:17 📢 Recognizing and addressing the impact of childhood trauma is understood to be a movement, necessitating widespread, integrative approaches.
11:45 ⚠️ Dr. Robert Block identifies adverse childhood experiences as a major, yet insufficiently addressed, public health threat.
12:38 🛠️ Addressing ACEs and toxic stress as public health crises provides a framework for deriving solutions, using toolkits that have successfully tackled other health problems like tobacco and lead poisoning.
13:05 🤔 The hesitation or failure in taking childhood trauma seriously might be due to a misconception that it only affects certain populations, even though data shows it’s a widespread issue affecting various demographic groups.
13:35 🙋 Childhood trauma is closer to home than many think, affecting even educated, Caucasian populations, but it might be marginalized because acknowledging it is often uncomfortable and challenging.
14:05 👀 There's a potential collective denial or minimization of the issue because it hits close to home for many, revealing that there is a shared, albeit avoided, problem in many families and communities.
14:34 🔬 Science has unveiled the clear, negative, long-term health impacts of early adversity, offering knowledge on how to prevent progression into disease and premature death.
15:05 🔄 Understanding and addressing connections between high ACE scores, behavioral symptoms, and physical health conditions could prevent numerous health issues in the future, turning them into anomalies.
15:35 🌐 The universal need is courage to confront the widespread reality of childhood trauma, recognizing its prevalence and significance, in order to build a movement toward addressing and mitigating its impacts.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"As a current medical student, it saddens me how little we talk about public health in our preclinical years. Topics like this are often saved for events outside of the classroom. However, I think all medical students could learn from public health. There is so much more to a patient than the person sitting right there in front of you. Their lived experiences play a huge role in their health that it seems like many do not understand on a deeper level. Listening to talks like this one makes me more optimistic about the changes I can make in the healthcare field. While many people want to be part of the change, it can be hard to go against a system that so many others believe in. However, the healthcare system does have its many flaws that need fixing. I think the changes that Dr. Harris made in her clinic seem like a great first step in promoting preventative care. 
	I would love to know more about how the Center for Youth Wellness is structured and how they were able to make these changes to their clinic. Overall, the addition of the Adverse Childhood Experience Survey in patient intake forms seems like a very feasible first step towards these health issues of chronic stress. I loved the idea of using the ACEs survey to have a better idea of the patient in front of you and know what they have more risks for. One area of this I would specifically be more curious about is how she goes about having conversations with parents about the ACE survey. Especially when the actions of the parents could very well be the reason why the ACE score for a patient is high. How do we talk to these parents with constant positive regard and leave them feeling good about the conversation? This conversation could be difficult for parents who may feel as if they have let their child down. How can we make parents aware of the toll their actions have on their child's health without offending or upsetting them? 
Overall, I really enjoyed this talk. It is conversations and presentations like this that make me excited about medicine. By taking these steps, Dr. Harris is acting as a great advocate for her patients. This type of work outside of the clinic shows me that the physician really wants to do good and promote health for their patients. In medical ethics, the concept of doing good is beneficence. When I see healthcare providers advocating for their patients outside of the clinic, it makes me feel as if they went into medicine to truly promote good for their patients in every aspect. To me, it seems like the ethical way to practice medicine is to promote good in every aspect of the patient's life as we possibly can.","Mental Health - Stress, Physical & Mental Wellness"

There's not currently enough research to answer that question.

I am from both sides of this issue, I suffered from emotional and psychological abuse from my narcissistic mother. All three children have mental health issues. I did not even know that I had mental health issues. I had one, two and then three children. I disagree with this discussion because you are defining the parent by their mental health issues. I chose to do the complete opposite of my mother, I , a single parent brought up my children with openness and honesty. I love them unconditionally and because of this love, I pushed myself to do anything they needed from me. They are three, very balanced, kind and happy individuals. Because, my acute depression, my O.C.D., my childhood sexual abuse, my narcissistic mother, my murderous sibling, my other alcoholic sibling ARE my trauma. Being their mother, I kept my suffering separate to their need for care. I explained why and what   were my later diagnosed mental disorders, so that they could understand that I loved them too much to break their spirit, the way my family did. I would “act” as a hard working professional, loving mother and when every child was asleep, I would then crumble into a woeful mess.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I was bullied for 6 years in school from the age of 10 till the age of 15. I was beaten with a cane by teachers for asking stupid questions. These teachers also called me names. My peers socially excluded me, as I was regarded as the fat ugly kid. I was the subject of ridicule inside and outside classes because of my looks. No one cared enough to get me help like counselling. I was told to get over it and stop being so sensitive. I naturally withdrew into my shell, as a result. I was too scared to approach and talk to people for fear of being laughed at or ridiculed. My father used to sometimes wonder why I never used to mix with other kids or why I had such low self-confidence levels! It just baffled me that he even asked that! Oh and just because my mother had a traumatic childhood herself where her mom used to beat her every single day, she used to downplay my horrid bullying experiences in school and that frankly hurt me so much. Even today, there are times when she gaslights me. Now, in my 30's, I still struggle with social anxiety and sometimes even when I am walking down the road, just minding my own business, I feel like I am being watched, stared at or laughed at by random strangers! It is such agony for me. Bullying should if you ask me be regarded as childhood trauma too. Bullying is not ok and can scar a person for life. Telling a child to 'get over it' is an apathetic and cruel response and must never be acceptable. At 35, I hope to talk to a therapist about all my experiences and have someone just listen to me and respect my feelings for a change and not belittle me.","Mental Health - Trauma, Personal Growth & Mindset, Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Anxiety"

For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Esto es muy cierto. Yo nací en una familia clase media, donde mis padres nunca se han separado, hasta el día de hoy siguen juntos. Sin embargo, por problemas de la infancia de mi papá, el alcohol siempre fue un tema difícil de lidiar para mi mamá. Soy la hija del medio de tres hermanos, y mi madre siempre fue la dominante en mi familia, mientras que mi papá tomaba el rol de sumiso. Nos criaron a los tres con el pensamiento de que nuestra educación era lo único propio que teníamos. De los tres, yo me lo tomé muy a pecho, ya que desde que nací, tuve problemas pulmonares hasta los 5 años. Sentía que debía enorgullecer a mis papás en mi vida escolar. Siempre estuve en el top 3 de mis compañeros. Sin embargo, el tema de la perfección me afectó mucho. Mis papás me daban cariño solamente cuando ganaba algo o si era sumisa con ellos. No debía causarles ningún problema. Lamentablemente, en el camino de ser aceptada y amada por ellos, desarrollé el mismo impulso de aprobación por parte de los demás. Por temas de mi físico, fui discriminada en mis primeros años de escuela. Me lo guardé.  A los 14 años, volví a ser marginada y sufrí de bullying por quienes creía que eran mis amigos. Paralelamente, la hermana de mi mamá tenía depresión y finalmente se suicidó cuando yo tenía esa edad. Eso me marcó muchísimo, porque justamente empecé a vivir ese momento de mi vida, había perdido también mi beca del colegio y las autoridades fueron muy crueles conmigo, recalcandome que jamás sería la mejor estudiante. Fueron tantas cosas, y por miedo a causarles daño a mis padres, jamás les conté. Y lo peor, fue que me creí todo lo malo que me decían, personas externas, que hasta intenté suicidarme en el baño de mi casa. Pero no lo hice... porque me di cuenta de que no era yo quien deseaba morir, yo solo quería que el resto dejara de odiarme y tratarme mal cuando solo quería ser una buena persona, una buena hija. Terminé después de eso, autolesionandome, de lo cual me arrepiento mucho, porque no merecía ese trato por parte mía. Como 9 meses después, en mitad de mis vacaciones, algo raro empezó a ocurrir con mi cuerpo. Empecé a tener diarrea, estreñimiento, y a botar mucha sangre a raíz de eso. Todo lo que comía, me empezó a hinchar y me daban ganas de vomitar o me causaba fatiga. Perdí tanta sangre y me dolía el estómago cada minuto que pasaba. Siempre disfruté el comer, porque me generaba una sensación de comodidad que me agradaba mucho, y de un momento a otro, se me fue imposibilitado el disfrutar de algo tan simple como un vaso de leche. Tiempo después, mis padres se enteraron porque me vieron desmayandome en el baño. Desde ahí empezó un cambio radical en mi, porque tuve que tomarme mi alimentación muy en serio.  Los exámenes arrojaron una respuesta autoinmune en mis intestinos. No había causa. No sabían el porqué ocurrió si yo estaba sana. He tenido que lidiar con el tema del colon y la alimentación, hasta el día de hoy. No soy capaz de disfrutar nada de lo que como o bebo, porque todo me hace mal. Y este año se acentuó, luego de vivir violencia de género en mi facultad. Tenía la hipótesis de que mi pésimo estado de salud, se debe a todos estos factores externos y traumas de la niñez. Mis padres siempre han sido sobreprotectores conmigo y me han limitado desde que era un bebé,  a realizar muchas cosas. Con este video, comprendo en parte de que la verdadera razón de mi condición física, es debido a los traumas que experimenté mientras crecía. Duele el saber que en la búsqueda de sobrevivir, terminas con cicatrices que no cierran, que estarán abiertas toda tu vida, pero de forma literal, porque no es sólo el sentimiento, sino que tiene una representación visual en la salud física de las personas.",Mental Health - Trauma

I'm healing and I'm learning, even just today at 26 years old I've realized I had to face ""food insecurity"" a lot as a child as food was withheld at times as ""punishment"" (aka my mum decided she couldn't be arsed or decided she wanted to hurt me). 

I have PTSD, anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, an eating disorder that's just about under control (binge eating) and hormonal imbalance issues and possible ADHD...

I live with these issues and it's hard but I'm learning to like being alive, to trust that others do not have an alterior motive, to beleive people when they say they're not mad at me, to be relaxed when someone touches me.... so many things.

Finding our families and our people later in life is so important, I'm hosting an ""orphan's christmas"" this year full of people I've grown close to, who have had simular childhoods.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I am 44 years old and the root of me comparing myself to others so severely especially to my sisters and cousins is because of a mismatched communication with my mom. She has always compared me to my sisters. Ironically I am the oldest daughter and sister. I am the one with the weird bumps on my skin so I felt I was never treated as smart, talented and beautiful. My sisters were always praised with pride when my sisters earned good grades, the attention and affection when they performed their multiple talents in singing and dancing, while I was ignored most of the time. My grades were average. I always thought I had a severe learning disability but only excused as lazy and stupid. Yes. I was, at the time, jealous, angry and envious. The mental and emotional capacity of feelings has been buried deep down. They are no happy childhood or cute stories about me. Except I am a trouble maker and seeking attention. In recent events, I wrote a letter to my mom, expressing how I feel going with the flow of my frustration of why can’t I be loved the way she loved loves my sisters? Her form of love was always “tough love”. The reason why she feels she does not know me is because she is quick to judge me and criticize me without an ounce of faith in me and how it is so complicated to live up to her expectations of being “good enough” to be loved by her. But despite our mismatched communication, I do love her for loving me the way she does. I was never a confrontational person. So writing is the only way to communicate. Since then there is a sense of peace between us. We have not really argued or bicker about nonsense things. She has been gentle, loving and forgiving which I found in myself to be truly loving and forgiving to me too. Letting go of everything-the toxic energy,etc. there is also a connection to my inner child and to nourish her with the love, attention and affection I never felt I received from my parents. I heard this phenomenal podcast with Mel Robbins that there’s this separation anxiety with me, my adult self to my inner child. It totally resonated with me. loving myself includes my inner child too. Giving her hugs and high fives. I guess giving the love, attention and affection I never truly got from my mom and dad. Lol 😂 😂😂 yes I am aware of repeating myself. I apologize if I don’t make sense and that I am strangely crazy. Letting go is an indescribable uplifting freedom .

I still live with them because of my age and I’m starting to have a lot of health problems. I’m constantly stressed and not allowed to go anywhere. I am forced to spend 24 hours a day 7 days a week with them. I’ve ended up in the hospital multiple times throughout my life and a lot more recently because of heart palpitations/pain. They never have an answer for me and part of me hopes they will know what the cause is. When they ask if I’m stressed, I always have to say no. My mom tries to act like she’s a good mom and basically wants to force me to go to therapy so I can get medication and be ‘fixed’. I refuse to go (which only causes more arguments) because I know it won’t solve the actual problem. I will probably need therapy for the rest of my life because of them. I refuse to get therapy to fix *my* problems when all of them are caused by them. It’s not my body or my mind’s fault for finally having had enough after almost 2 decades.

It's tough",Mental Health - Trauma
95ovIJ3dsNk,"I experienced all the made-for-tv childhood traumas (not war though). Isolation, neglect, seeing extreme violence in the home, a flood, physical and emotional abuse,  sexual abuse... this all lead to dissociative episodes and strange behaviour which lead to bullying from both peers and teachers, and so on. All this lead to a lifestyle that provided me with traumas in young adulthood.

Untreated ptsd did lead me to substance use and eventually a major breakdown. The breakdown though - lead to resilience, learning persistence, and healthy acceptance (not complacency) and it lead to my changing the view and meanings I'd made about my life and past... it guided me to a better understanding of myself, to more interests, to overcoming addictions, freeing myself from mental illnesses, and enjoying contributing. It lead me to being happy with whatever comes including more stress, pain, sadness... and once i finally really broke, had one too many traumas and obstacles in healing it actually lead me to  overcome years of suicidal ideation, it lead me to the feet of god - as it were - and it lead me to realising that i can get through damn near anything and the thing i can't get through will take me to my rest/ peace.

Some of the strongest, most resilient, most adaptive, interesting, mature, and happy people are exactly those with a ton of ACES. 

BTW, No - Humans do not have a fight or flight only system of response to stress! Insisting on spreading this very unscientific view is detrimental to everyone (it was a misunderstanding of something said by the researcher credited with ""discovering"" fight or flight - and he also denounced it later). 

We are humans with many natural options in the face of stress. One option is compliance - people who've experienced trauma and been brainwashed into thinking that we should have either fought or fled (or frozen) have so much shame and confusion piled on when, as often is the case, they went with being complicit instead. Another more empowering option is 'tend and befriend'. During times of high stress and trauma the people with the least pts- symptoms are the ones who got involved in helping others during the situation but even they may feel damaged/ that there's something wrong with them and have the severity of their experience invalidated when they're assured that if the situation was really traumatic they would have only been able to fight or flee. How about the challenge response? We view the traumatic situation or the lives we're left with as a challenge, a puzzle (not something or someone to fight or flee from but something to solve, learn, and advance from). Are we also to feel defective for no longer catering to a fight-or-flight only model?

When faced with a bear, we can run, fight, play dead, calm it (depending on situ) , outsmart it, scare it with noisy instruments, vomit, feed it something better... Our bodies/ brains give us the hormones, energy, juice to have lots of options to stay alive. We don't always pick the right one and believe it or not, preaching fight-or-flight actually even screws people up when faced with an actual bear!

If you want to help people with high ACE scores give us access to people who have experienced the most post-traumatic growth, give the same words of wisdom and guidance that gets one person through a trauma essentially unscathed to the person who experiencing the exact same trauma, is damaged... stop spreading fear, stop telling bodies that have experienced horrible things to produce horrible outcomes. 

Life should be safe for children, trauma shouldn't be there especially in the home, the fact that people can benefit from these things doesn't justify causing the trauma... rubbing in how terrible our lives are / have been/ and will be because of what we've experienced is almost as bad though - it's taking the side of those who traumatised us and reinforcing our victimhood rather than taking the side that empowers us. 

Instead, yes teach parents how important it is to give kids a safe home in private but also publicly give us the space to face the experience we couldn't deal with, in a safe way. Stop punishing us for the breakdowns and needing time to heal. Give us back the dignity of a species that has grown exactly from traumas into being technologically and artistically interesting if not advanced , a species that actually can handle stress and trauma.

The real damage comes from learned helplessness, from being so disempowered that we feel useless in any difficult situation... feeling the very way that we're being told 'science' has 'discovered' we are in the face of these things.","Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Addiction, Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Trauma, Recovery & Self Care"

As I’d there weren’t enough, my mom and dad were both heroin addicts, my dad was also an alcoholic…he used to beat my mom near-death for years. He died of an overdose when I was 14. I got pregnant & was a single mom by 18 & my middle brother was in and out of jail and I had to be his surrogate mom, bc my mom abandoned us when my dad died…I was 14, my brother was 12. My youngest brother who was 9, was taken by my mom and exposed to horrific things, including her prostitution and him being sexually abused by a man (her “friend”) at age 10. I “pulled myself up from my bootstraps” so to speak (hate that term, really), and went on to get a college degree and have a successful career working at large-public ally listed companies…even reaching the level of Vice President. But…but…I’ve NEVER felt comfortable in that corporate environment, I’ve never been around people like me, it rubs me the wrong way that all many of them care abt is money and I can’t help but look around and see so many “entitled” people who are ungrateful and dismissive of those who are less fortunate. I read the book “The body keeps score” in 2018 and realized I score at 8/10 on ACE and while I was able to push the trauma aside (bc I had no other choice for me and my son…I needed to survive), I now see the effects. I have horrible unexplained digestive issues, I’m allergic to all kinds of things, I have ongoing chest pain that can’t be explained, I’ve had a really hard time controlling my weight and, now in my late 40s, I realize if I don’t take care of my health, I’m going to go downhill quickly—and I’m certain my body is breaking down bc of these early childhood experiences. My mind and my body were so taxed, for years, that my immune system is shot. So. I’m turning to veganism (which really helps reduce the chest pains), yoga and meditation, and I’m being kinder to myself…extending that compassion I have for others, inward.

Each yes answer was given 1 point and the total Ace score was subtracted. Later, Ace scores in the study were associated with health problems. According to the results, it was determined that Ace was very common and 67% of the population had ACE. . A relationship has been found between ACE and health problems. The higher the Ace, the higher the health problem. Having an Ace score carries a higher risk of health problems than those without an Ace score.

She hit a point there I'm amazed I finally understand why I was so drawn to drugs especially experiencing constant bullying trauma and childhood violence at home not that much but the screaming and seeing my dad drunk and then abuse my mum was killing me every time and very destructive for my head even in kindergarten I was bullied so whole 10,14 yrs being bullied played big part in that now I have asthma ,lymphodema, undiagnosed fainting dizzines and nasal polyps and heart arrhythmia I rarely leave my house and since I was 12 my social circle was thinning so much that being 14 yrs old I had no one left I had about 8/10 suicide attempts with extreme depression that would just appear and make me so low i would want to die and be free my mental pain it was so horrible I'm now 25 in few days and I actually haven't spoke with anyone outside my mum and dad for 9years off course I don't mean situations where I'm speaking with lady at the till buying water or just speaking with strangers because you have to in order to do something I mean real friends where you can share everything and have that support. this is so destructive people /kids need to understand that bullying might be funny for kids or for parents that it's something you will get through but with some of us it sticks to us whole lifeand destroys us , I also had best friend who diched me for more interesting friends I knew her since we were born ! We moved together with parents to UK and started school together she was poor and I would even share with her my small pocket money so we can eat together at McDonald's so she wouldn't have to sit and look at me eating when I knew they been poor my parents also gave food to them when in need in return our family was cursed in our home country so every time I would go to holiday visit my home and grandparents I would be chased with knifes they spread so much lies and destructive words like B*&^ and so on since then it was even worse I never accepted the fact I lost this friendship and I do still have dreams where we talk and are like friends which is almost 14years after this happened I know we are a bit half and half to blame but It was her few first moves that pushed me away and together with the bullying I changed the school unfortunately that school was not that good aswell only for first 1,5 year I was OK and get to hang out with few girls but then again as I felt i was again not liked like the other girls liked eachothers then it stopped and I don't even talk with them anymore I don't know for some reason I just can't keep up a relationship with people as I do have times of complete silence where I want to be alone and then feel bad to just reappear in their life like nothing happened being sure they don't like this ,and just trying to avoid situations Is what I can do very well I just prefer to not cope with any stress. it's stress that puts me off doing things and I just spend time in my shell which is fine any other day but not for whole 14 years !

Then when that finished, I started high school, and was bullied relentlessly for my looks (racial), weight, mannerisms (feminine tendencies). The other kids would pull my hair, hit me, burn me with bunsen burners during science class, kick me, spit on me and just make my life a misery. I was suicidal by the age of 12, constantly crying and writing suicide notes, but was always too afraid to go through with it.

Needless to say, those childhood experiences have completely damaged me as a person. I've suffered for years since, with crippling anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts.

Now that I'm reaching my 40's, My life is such a mess. I have no career. Have made some awful decisions and awful mistakes, and I'm just generally a complete loser with nothing going for me. 

The anxiety and depression have got worse with age. I'm practically scared and fearful of everything and everyone. I was agoraphobic for a number of years and lost out on so much.

I also have a body deformity too which hasn't helped with my confidence, and loose skin due to losing weight as I became very obese during my youth.

I’ve experienced multiple of physical health issues and I’m the only person with the most health issues in the family. As far as I remember, it started with minor anemia when I was 7 or 8. I grew up in a dysfunctional family but never thought that it was the main factor of my first issue and the rest after it. I’ve been sick with different health issues every year. I wondered “why am I the only one who’s always sick?” Now that I look back, I’m the person that has been exposed to trauma the most compared to my younger siblings. In the end, I’m the oldest child and have to carry the family burdens by myself. I believe that I could’ve had less health issues if I had someone as emotional support because I have never ONCE vent my feelings or personal problems to anyone.. I used to think to myself that I’m strong enough to bring all the pain and secrets to grave without anyone knowing. I guess I’m not as strong anymore, after holding on and keeping to myself for 14 years. Due to my childhood experience, I think that it’s best for me to not have best friends, or create a family of my own because I don’t want to hurt anybody. My family always tell me that I can be selfish and narcissist. I’m an empath and HSP, so it hits deeply to my soul. Everything that my parents told me damaged my self esteem and will stay with me until I die. I fell out of love with life since I was 6 or 7. Nobody asked for my story but I’m having an emotional burnout and I have trouble talking about my feelings loudly, even to myself. Maybe that’s why there are voices in my head and it would never shut up. I mostly take 2-3 hours to fall asleep for the past months. I have a quiz tomorrow, and another quiz in 4 days…I don’t know how am I gonna handle it. I could just flop both quizzes but I am a perfectionist and have always excel academically since I was 9. The academic pressure and stress distract me from my real problem, so I like studying and striving for good grades. You know what? I honestly feel that I failed in this life. Nothing good will ever happen to me and even if it does, I will not be able to enjoy it to the fullest. I’m doomed for life (and the hereafter). If I can put it in a metaphor, it’s like I wanna scream for help but my vocal chord is not functioning because I haven’t speak for years and now it’s affecting other things in my life since I don’t know how to use sign language.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I'm hoping someone can answer my questions -- if you can, please don't hesitate to comment. I am nearing 31 years old and am starting to put the dots together on my many inflammatory diseases. Last year someone turned me on to the ACE test and I was flabbergasted to receive an 8 out of 8 score. So, after years of adjusting my lifestyle and trying different medications, I'm profoundly upset to discover that at the root of my diseases is this underlying trauma that, by all conclusive evidence, is beyond the scope of medicine and could very well take thirty years off my lifespan. I just can't accept that -- it's an extremely painful prognosis. I'm trying everything I can to find meaningful intervention. I'm finding a lot of material that supports the connection between trauma and inflammation, like this talk by Nadine Burke Harris which was profound and moving. But I can find next to no material that can help me begin to take real steps to making a meaningful intervention on my disease as a grown adult. Cognitive and behavioral therapies fail to target what is happening in my body. Chronic PTSD coursework can make my waking mind feel mature but utterly fails to do anything to my autoimmunity. Inflammation continues to overwhelm every corner of my body and the prescribed dose of hormones and steroids just keeps climbing. My question is this: has anyone else with a very high ACEs test result found a way forward? Did any interventions work for you? What strategies helped heal your limbic system? What methods did you pursue? Were you ever able to get lasting healing? I'm just feeling so stuck and hurt and scared from these emerging studies that say that a person with my background is likely to die so much earlier, after suffering a pretty miserable quality of life. I just can't accept that. I need healing. If you have experienced a similar amount of ACEs and have found healing as an adult, I would really love to know what has worked for you.","Recovery & Self Care, Mental Health - Trauma"

95ovIJ3dsNk,"LGTM 5004 Allison Lindsay. I have heard of ACE's before but I always focused on the psychological and behavioral results and not actual physiological results such as diseases. I am shocked that my adverse experiences in childhood may have been the root cause of my own current health challenges. This makes me stop and wonder how many of my own clients have experiences of trauma and adverse experiences which are impacting their current medical diagnosis. Nakazawa speaks about the power of having just one reliable adult in their lives. It makes me introspect. Am I being a reliable adult for the children and adolescents who are referred to me for help? Often when their homes and families offer no compassion, it is the school, church and Healthcare providers who offer compassion and understanding to children in need. This will definitely affect how I practice in future. This knowledge cannot be denied. It is so common across society and it levels the field. It is not just those persons from that poor neighborhood but it affects children across social classes.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"LGTM5004 Take three, of attempting to comment and have it appear. I commented on the relevance of this talk of the use of multidisciplinary team approaches and in my practice of being a school psychologist in private practice. The centre that Dr. Bruke mentioned in San Fransisco is a dream land that I wish I could visit and be part of. When working with children, and then working in an island where ACE's such as abuse, divorce, domestic violence to name a few are common, it should be best practice that we have team approaches in clinics, hospitals and schools, unfortunately this does not appear to happen. I find that instead of the exosystem of our children such as the government/media/school boards, etc mandating that is should be occuring, especially as the evidence is so clearly stated, the data is avaialble, it more falls on the professional or even the parent to invest in ensuring that the child gets that team approach. I know that the schools have their social workers and guidance officers, who have huge case loads and three or four schools at a time, and I know that everyone is working as hard as they can in the situation that they are in. But when we have managed to coordinate meetings through the hardwork of a prinicpal or parent, where the Psychologist is present, the social worker, the principal, parents and teachers are present, the progress and the information that is shared in those meetings are impactful. One can also observe the sense of relief of each party that they also have a support team as the burden does not only fall on one party. Therefore I understand and see the importance of this multi-team approach and look forward to the day that this can be provided to across the islands and is acessible to all, until then, I shall do my part to always try and use a team approach.",other

But I remind myself that there are so many other kids who go through similar situations and many even have it worse than I do.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"LGTM 5004  It was surprising as to the medical conditions, such as cancer and heart related illness that ACES have on individuals. There is no alarm as it relates to mental health challenges with respect to ACES, as I work as a social worker on the psychiatric ward.  We utilize the biopsychosocial approach in assisting/ assessing persons who are diagnosed with a mental illness, and in most cases the onset of a mental illness is correlated with some adverse trauma/ or experience.  However, surprisingly, the actual concept of ACES has never been used on the psychiatric ward.

However, I would seek more to try to understand why ACES are not frequently discussed in the medical field from the perspective of the social worker working in a hospital setting. We I reviewed the questionnaire used to generate the ACES score; I could see where these questions could deem as being very intrusive by the patients. Can you imagine going to the doctor for asthma related issues, and the doctor asking if you have every been sexual abused or have a primary caregiver who had mental illness. Secondly, before asking these questions there would need to be rapport and trust that patients feels and honestly the average person would not be truthful when answering these questions. There is a skill set that would need to be thought to other medical doctors in retrieving this information, rather that just asking a question from a questionnaire, thus how medicine is taught would need to be changed. Therefore, considering the social and psychological factors to the onset of a medical condition should not only apply in the area of psychiatry. The general clinic setting or emergency area does not allow for such private conversations to be had between the medical doctor and the patient, and some doctors would feel uncomfortable in asking such intimate questions. It is important to understand the medical and mental health challenges that are a caused by exposure to ACES and seek to utilize such knowledge in the overall treatment of both adults and children. However, this means that much more psychologists, social workers, dietitians are needed to effectively utilize the biopsychosocial model across all areas of medicine.

Although we remain acutely aware of the scourges of trauma and adverse events that children experience, we continue to operationalize their care and treatment in speciality-limited silos; not taking the entire context into consideration. While there is greater awareness of the effects of trauma on immediate and longer term mental wellness, the further impact on increasing risks of chronic medical conditions and even adult mental health requires further visibility in our region. As such, armed with this knowledge, as a child health provider I am moved to take more action to increase screening in our clinics (which currently does not happen) and based on outcomes provide further preventive and intervention initiatives for those at risk. While I am aware of the need for multimodal approaches along a biopsychosocial model, with regret I am aware that this is scarcely the reality in our setting. This video reinforces the need for us as a collective to raise awareness, inform our practices and improve our health across the lifecourse.","Physical & Mental Wellness, Mental Health - Trauma"
95ovIJ3dsNk,"LGTM 5004 It is likely that ACEs have remained largely unaddressed in the medical field as the reductionist approach to health still pervades clinical medicine. Clinical problems eg hypertension are sectioned off and addressed individually. This is accompanied by an overspecialization in healthcare with fragmented interventions being offered to patients. In addition, ACEs are deeply personal, painful experiences that clients may have difficulty divulging and allowing themselves to be vulnerable, unless they have a level of comfort and rapport with the healthcare provider. The contact time with clients in a busy public clinic or with managed care may not be sufficient to build that therapeutic alliance. 
Moreover, the unearthing of ACEs in a clinical setting may involve referrals to other agencies. This, then, adds to the complexity and cost of the treatment options for the client which may be a less desirable alternative for a busy healthcare worker.",other

Another I was there for nearly a week due to the week end and holiday. At that place a lot of other “peoples “ guesses were negated in favor of CHRONIC PTSD.. 
my score was 6/10 which explained exactly what I went thru from birth( my mother(?) did not want a girl. That woman told me from day one that everything that happens to me is my own fault. When my brother was born, I nearly did not exist. At the age of 3 I walked a 1/4 mi to my grandmas to get some love and attention. At the age of 5, I was sexually molested, “she” had said it was my own fault. My father called me names because I tended to be rebellious. I had no idea how to act towards others.

That is at minimum a thirty-three year gap. I was diagnosed with everything under the sun that was either trendy or an easy explanation at the time. Some of those diagnoses could even be argued in court as libel per se. We need to have a system where school systems, healthcare systems, and governing bodies are held to a lifelong standard of liability for things like that. And a more stringent system of screening for child abuse.
Oh, I am also autistic. My mother was twenty-one years and a few months old when I was born. And yes, age of the mother at birth is a major factor in the child's outcomes regardless of any ""special needs"". So you have an autistic and mentally ill child being raised by a young mother in the social system in the 1980s. I kid you not when I say my personal experience tells me that governments could throw every antivaxxer and curebie in the slam then pay every autistic individual currently alive a billion dollars a day, and that would only be in the ballpark of compensatory justice.

Unfortunately, I think the neglect caused me to gain a draconic identity at the age of 7. At 7 years old I felt like a dragon instead of a human and those feelings exist even now as an adult. So I do believe that abuse messes up certain parts of the brain. I think my sense of identity was permanently messed up causing me to feel the way that I do. Other than my dragon identity, OCD like cleanliness, and dislike of change, I seem to act perfectly normal. I never really fell into self harm, depression, or the sort.

We need to move away from talking too much about the persons mental health - yes talk about it at the beginning and find the root cause is the first step. From my experience the person has to work in steps. The first step is talking about your mental health. Second step is to stop talking about your mental health and learn how to ignore it. Third step is to the learn how to love  and respect people, telling your children/ friends that you 'love them' even if you don't have the experience/feelings of love. Final step is learn to love yourself. You cannot learn to love yourself until steps 1-3 are accomplished to some degree. After this you will find happiness.",Positive Psychology

So I went to the dr and he prescribed me concerta for concentration and it worked . I could “focus “ and I wasn’t always feeling tired ,and my mood picked up .I would spend less hours studying whereas before I would spend way more.
It took me till this year to realize I do not have adhd but depression as I at one point hit a low ,I also thankfully never had any serious side affects from the tablet until recently and stopped it without telling my mother. Also note that I didn’t take concerta continuously for those years ,maybe at 3 months at a time 
It sucks it took me a while to realize I don’t have adhd but depression through the trauma /abuse at home from my mother 
I’m still trying to work on myself and will hopefully move out soon.

I live in a nice small house and i have everything i would need material wise. i have clothing and I can ask for food whenever and have an education. So, whenever i find myself crying amover my at home situation, I feel sort of like i shouldnt be crying if i have all this stuff other people dont. like my problems are not worth my pain but i know all of our sufferings shouldnt be compared. what makes it worst is that my feelings are all over the place. my dad will one day be yelling and fightung eith my mom which can sometimes be physical, my mom will yell for help and ill just hide. My earliest memory lf this was when i was like than 10 years old. maybe 7. My unclde had come in the house and stopped them after consoling me. but anyways, theyll fight and then the next hour or day theyre all fine? more specifically, my dad will be all nice with me like we are all a happy family like i should forget. I can not forget. I cant. They fought today again which is why I am here. I just learned he would fight with my mom when she was pregnant with me. I just want a normal life. I will wait until I graduate and move out and see if i am still alive because I have struggled eith suicidal thoughts. I have never attempted because I am afraid.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"When i was 5 years old my father took  me from my mother with her conscent, to live with him and his new wife. 
 It quickly bacame apparent to me that she took an instant dislike to me, more like hatered. She had four children of her own. Anyway the abuse started off almost immediately making me stand in the corner of the room facing the wall for absolutely no reason that a five year old child would understand anyway.  The days went on with low level mental abuse, well to a five year old boy it was devastating. My father was a long distant driver so all this abuse took place when he was out, but he could see that I was unhappy there. So her four children started to bully me and attacked me in the house. They had a dog that use to nip me, and they would all just laugh. I started to hear her mother say to her, ""Why don't you just dump him somewhere.""  So after a year of mental tourment at the hands of everyone in that house, she finally decided  to take her mothers advice and dump me on the street I was only 6 years. So Social services placed me with a foster family but after a year the moved me to a children's home. That was a blow to me because I became part of a loving family. When I was 8 years old they moved me to another children's gome where I stayed for 8 years.  I left  the children's home when I was 16, then they moved me to another children's home for a year, then when I was  17  they moved me to an half way house to get me use to an independant life.  I left the care system as I went in feeling alone, worried, & affraid. Of course i have not put every awful experience in this post.  Thank You.",other

She appears to be addressing this objection about 40% of the way through when she raises the response of some that it's not surprising b/c this is all ""behavioral.""

THAT objection, the way she describes it, is more a reduction of the problem(s) to mere non-biological factors, as if those things don't interact with/affect biology/physiology.  Of course they do.

Nor does my score reflect the majority of my upbringing and/or the quality of parenting I received,
there are many variables to every individual, situation and experience.
Yet, for some reason, I am still hesitant in opening up about this particular type of topic.
Perhaps it is because I wouldn't want anyone to feel offended or in any way guilty of anything I don't believe they should do.
Perhaps it is because of the fact that sadly, we still live in a society where ignorance rules a person's judgements and more often than not, there's repercussions for sharing certain truths.
OR 
Perhaps there are still too many people suffering themselves in some way and it's their inability to confront themselves that makes people like me less able to overcome my traumatic experiences and the accumulation of issues that are associated with them.

I FOUND THIS AMAZING TRAUMA THERAPY

It's taught by a Muslim Sheikh, but, as he explains, it's not related to religion. 

I've used it myself and it's phenomenal. It's very simple and highly effective once you know how to use it properly. It's recommended to do it with two people, but you can do it by yourself, which is what I did as I like to keep things private. 

It's important to listen to the whole lecture carefully (it's in 2 parts) so you can get a clear understanding of how to apply it. I listened to it carefully twice before using it. It's helped me beyond description. It works on children too.

English is not his first language, but you will be able to understand him. Just have patience - it is truly worth the effort.

Those heavily traumatised will need multiple sessions to clear everything out, but you can notice and feel the progress as you go along. 

Please share this amongst your contacts so those suffering can benefit. I'm sure this can help many people. Even non-abused people should use it.

Im tough on her, I am strict with my expectations and I have high morals and work ethic and try to impart this on her. She thinks I am the worst mom there is, she has said it before.

I CHOSE not to have children, probably the 'best decision' I've ever made, the abuse was severe enough that I didn't want to even chance it.    The one point I'd add to this topic is that along with abuse sometimes comes a lack of love.  This stuff  basically ruined me, I've spent my lifetime trying to 'get better.'  Never married, no kids, isolation, suicidal ideation are themes to my life now.  Every day is a struggle and I pray to God for help each morning.  I have a dog named ""larry"" who helps me through and I'm an artistic, creative person, as you'd expect I suppose.  My brain is good and the creative process is probably the best therapy for me at this point.  I could have been so much in life but didn't achieve much by societies, or my own, standards.  There was too much 
'stuff' always in the way of my achieving anything much.  The struggle is endless but there are moments of contentment.  Life is hard for everyone giving a kid a starting point of abuse is disgusting to me.  That's all I can say, God bless you and have a good day.",Mental Health - Therapy

But all my mom gave to me was a house and just financial support for my studies. The moment I decided I do not enjoy the college program they are forcing me to finish is the moment they stopped supporting me, even financially. My parents became so much worse after that. My mom often calls me ugly and always guilt trip me at everything I do, especially when I do the things that make me calm or happy. She even says that my boyfriend will eventually break up with me because of my ""attitude"" and ""behavior"". She started calling me a drug addict even though I refused to take drugs. I just play video games, make art using my laptop, and just outline the story I've been trying to work on for years now. My parents say that watching anime and playing video games are like taking drugs and honestly, my parents just want me to be the child that I want. 
Anyway, I may have ranted too much. I really wish my mother didn't give birth to me if she'll only treat me like this. It's like I am the biggest mistake in her life.

This is actually a very EVIL thing to do, but I know many people and organizations who do this. They might actually profit from it. That is why we should be very careful about stigmatizing and labeling people who have been hurt or abused in some way, because it often continues the victimization of that individual. You cannot heal if you are labeled and kept in a sea of dwelling on the negative -- Often very old negative happenings that frankly should be let go, that don't matter anymore. We as human beings have a powerful ability to overcome a lot, and also grow from negativity if we are allowed to put it behind us, but when you are overwhelmed by it or drowned in it, then you cannot breath or grow.",other

People think it’s so sad to be a stripper but what people don’t realize is normal girls can’t do this job for good reason. 

Girls who strip do so because they have already been through trauma, every shift is slightly traumatic and you are in flight or fight for hours especially on stage ... it has been destroying my body. 

I have known for a long time that I hold my trauma in my body. 

Every day for years as a young pre teen I didn’t know what would happen that day, is my dad alive is he dead is my mom okay or is she angry that day. 

Literally living in a silent battlefield ... barley eating and constantly sleeping critical teen years ... 

My trauma is mostly in my back , it literally aches. 

I’m 25 and I feel like I’m 40 ... I feel incredibly weak as in my bones and I know that cancer is a large possibility for me at this point if it hasn’t started already. It’s something deep in my core I feel ... I feel physically weak like I am regressing 

But I also know how powerful the mind and body are as well 

I know that part of my journey is understanding the ancestral trauma ... not identifying with my children trauma and not victimizing myself but just accepting and learning 

Trauma is a gift from the universe you just have to give it back once you’ve seen it and accepted that gift in it’s entirety 

I watched my father destroy himself with alcohol for over a decade now, his motor function and basic human skills are seriously impaired and I genuinely don’t know how his liver hasn’t failed. 

After years and years of bullshit on and off distance he causally told me that his older step sister molested him repeatedly as a child. 

So much of my life was dealing with adults problems and suffering the consequences of my parents mistakes... mistakes and families were broken from unresolved trauma 

I have done so much self work, I have dug down and understood my life and I am determined to let my children reach their full potential 

That’s what this is all about 

The children , giving them not what you or I didn’t get but what we all deserve

And rather upgrades studies for future generations. I think this type of tactic is out dated. As it still undermines the core issues and seems to support control over the masses, in which these tactics are clearly mainly being exercised. During this corona virus pandemic, we lost over 300,000.00 worldwide, and are only in the stages of considering which way to treat this pandemic. However it’s still a must to reopen the companies. Because we don’t have a safe net. In 2014 Obama was asking for funding to prepare for such events. Which was denied. I’m no Obama fan, but the loss of lives during this pandemic, was considered in 2014 as unimportant. Funding instead only focus on the United States company. Not the people. Health care during this pandemic shows the concern isn’t the health of the people. It’s the company’s that have the health of wealth. Child hood trauma could be curable, once greed, voracity is no longer the obsession. We are to wake, work and eat for the company’s. Not our self or families. So choose.

I was told by my daughter's Kaiser doctors that my daughter was just getting strep throat all the time, so they would give her antibiotics 6 times a year.   We were both complaining that, at night, she would stop breathing for full minutes, sleep apnea...In middle school the lack of sleep and constant exposure to antibiotics was making her tired and she had a hard time focusing, in her questionnaires she wrote I DONT GET ENOUGH SLEEP.    Kaiser doctors kept trying to force RITALIN and THEN PROZAC...   FINALLY after 8 years of this, an ED doctor says ""sometimes if we take the tonsils out the ""strep throat"" goes away.""   I screamed 'WELL THEN TAKE THEM OUT!!!!""    It took me three more months of begging to get her tonsils out and Voila!  ""strep throat"" gone.     Kaiser was trying to railroad my daughter into chronic mental health drugs for TONSILLITIS!!!!!  No kidding KAISER WAS TRYING TO PUSH PSYCH DRUGS ON A CHILD FROM THE AGES OF 11 TO 16 FOR TONSILLITIS!!!!   DO NOT TRUST KAISER PERMANENTE.  I now feel ashamed that i didn't understand it was tonsillitis but those doctors actually concealed this fact from me.   HORRIBLE DOCTORS.   In 1998-2003, the ""medical system"" put MILLIONS OF KIDS ON PSYCH DRUGS - money money money - many lost their lives to suicide after starting psych drugs.   I BET A LOT OF THOSE POOR KIDS JUST HAD TONSILLITIS LIKE MY DAUGHTER.   LET'S RESEARCH THAT!!!!    Check the news - every year Kaiser gets fined or publicly shamed for SCAMMING their membership out of seeing a mental health care doctor AFTER THROW PSYCH DRUGS AT THEM.     Anyways, what is this woman talking about?   We are quite aware of which children are living in crisis there are so many in the worst states of poverty, dangerous schools, parent thrown in jail - GO HELP THEM!!!!   What on earth is she going to do with this research?   Kaiser doesn't actually want to really provide healthcare, we see that in the news.    Notice how she doesn't actually say what they are going to do after they crawl up your butt with a microscope - THEY WANT EVERYONE ON PSYCH DRUGS with no doctor oversight.   They certainly are not going to spend time with these kids.   Oh and by the way, our tax dollars just handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to a bunch of hospital systems for this totally stupid waste of money research that could have gone to KIDS THAT NEED HELP AND SUPPORT OR THE SCHOOLS THAT LACK FUNDING THEY ATTEND.  This black woman stands there and says we need to investigate everyone's deep background to find kids to help?   There are so many kids in this country THAT OBVIOUSLY NEED A LOT OF HELP WE CAN'T POSSIBLY GET TO ALL OF THEM and she doesn't see them  she thinks she needs to investigate everyone's background ?  This is the most ridiculous BS i've ever heard.  When i discovered how much of our tax dollars were being thrown at this stupid research  i say YEP of course there's the real motivation MONEY.

Mission description/duration: 14days on 24hr off, Consisting of 10-12hr daily Aircraft Operational hours. 70% Approximation of said operational hrs was under hot gas conditions, conducted at various FARPs. Personal operational experience during above but not limited to; tending horrifically wounded fellow soldiers, capture/recovery, Aerial close fire support, Team Infill/Xfill, Aerial C&C, countless engagement with direct enemy fire.

With mind being stuck on full blast it causes me to relive my traumas C-PTSD at warp speed 24/7. The following  is my best attemp at an analogy of how the past 14 years have felt.

You feel the air, the sensation of speed as the ground  hurdles toward you, its terrifyingly beautiful. At 1000ft you ready for the violent embrace of canopy. You reach for your primary, finding to your horror.......you have NO chute. In the midst of your frantic racing mind, you notice, in exquisite detail, every object below, that in seconds, will meet you face to face. 5,4,3,2,1........freeze! Now encapsulated all your current emotions and thoughts at this very moment. Now hop in a car and drive to work or the store. Try and sit still long enough to fill out a 15 page VA benefits thesis as your eyes rapidly dart from exit to exit, and pray you filled it out correctly. Worst of all, try leave the back room of your mothers home to simply to talk with a friend checking up on you. Trying the whole time desperately not flee in fear or piss your pants. The comically long list of meds the VA has forced down my throat, and all the doctors I've been bounced between have only served to land me in the IPU multiple times out of fear Ill pull my own RIP cord!.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I think We created ADHD by replacing unconditional love by being adequate and fit for the challenge .
By pushing our kids to be the best version of ourselves and forgetting that they are unique individuals who have their own dreams and desires while forgetting our most important rule as parents 
Giving them love , security, acceptance and support to be the best version of themselves and not from us.

Or may be we just made our kids our “ safe targets “ for easing up our anger and frustration from ourselves and unconsciously abused them and reinforced the vicious cycle of abuse through generations.

ADHD is not just an active child who is acting childish and easily distracted 
This is just a description of the outcome
I think it’s a disorder that resulted from generations that inherited an attitude of not offering love , security and acceptance 
Nearly all individuals who have ADHD , have rejection sensitivity dysphoria 
Sensitive to rejection because they Crave acceptance 
They crave love
They crave to the extent that they might eat a poison just because they can’t stand the feeling of hunger 
They always seek love and to feel good
They engage in impulsive behaviors that they know they will face their consequences just because they can’t control their craves to feel loved and acceptance 
ADHD should be named Love deficit hyper sensitive disorder instead of attention deficit hyperactive disorder

95ovIJ3dsNk,"When I was four, my mother returned to university to upgrade her education.
She left me for that year with her sister.  She did not visit me once.
The university was literally across the street from her sister's house and me.
When I was six, I drank a slurry of milk and vitamin D tablets to poison myself before she came home and whipped me again with the electric frying pan cord.
I was six.  
When I was seven we traveled to Europe.  One time I'm in a park, I look around, can't find her.  I'm terrified, I rush around, calling for her.  I find her, race up to her, crying.  
She tells me to 'stop running around like a chicken with its head cut off.'
She then went on a London to Singapore overland trip for seven months, leaving me with her mother.
When I was nine, she put me in boarding school for two years to learn how to make friends while she went to teach in Bermuda.  
She left me with strangers for two years, for ten months of bullying and neglect straight at a time.
When I was old enough to do chores, that's when she stopped leaving me behind.
Do the dishes, do the vacuuming, do the grocery-shopping, do the laundry.
Listen to her complain daily about her life, what it was like for her growing up, the bad teachers at her schools, the lousy principals.
I can't look at pineapple without hearing her complain about how as a child she used to like pineapple till her grandmother fed her enough to make her sick.
I like the Lord Wimsey stories by Dorothy L. Sayers.  She didn't, so she called him ""Lord Wimpy.'
She watched Coronation Street religiously for decades, never interrupt her when she's watching.
I once begged her to please stay out of my room when I'm writing an essay, the constant interruptions stress me.
Ten minutes later, she comes in. Again.
I'm in a room, she calls out my name loud and long, nearly a screech.
I race in, heart pounding.
She's in a chair next to a paperback rack, 'move these from this row to this one.""
She couldn't reach out and move those herself, she called me in because ""I pay for the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the roof over your head, so do what I say!""
I had to be the good one, I had to be the one who was reasonable, who made accomadations, who understood.  Never her.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Thank you for this presentation. I shared it with my Mom. I hope she watches it. 

My Dad was violent, rageful, and verbally abusive as well and came from an extremely abusive background. He is a recovering alcoholic and still has a lot of pain from his own past that weighs on him. I also still struggle with the repercussions of my own childhood that stem from both my Dad and older brother being pretty awful and scary. 

I have forgiven my Dad and mostly have just sympathy and compassion for him now. Knowing that he grew up in such a horrible household and still tried to make a good life for himself.

I have forgiven my brother too but he has done a lot less in terms of facing his own past, facing his pain, and demons. So he's a pretty unhealthy person to be around even now.

It's taken me at least 10 years of therapy to get to this point but I still have a lot of work to do to be the functional, happy person I ultimately want to be.

I'm so glad that people like you are learning more about this and continue to do the necessary work and research.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I remember when I was 14, I had these horrible chest pains. It felt as if something was squeezing my heart. They would wake me up in the middle of the night. When I told my mother, she claimed I was making it up or faking it. My dad's parents thankfully paid for me to go to the doctor. They did all kinds of tests on me... and in the end, the doctor literally told me it was STRESS that was causing this. I wish so much that they would have secreted me away to a counselor to talk about things, because the truth is, I had been dealing with active childhood trauma since the age of 7 due to my parents' behavior towards me and towards each other. I finally had a breakdown right in school when I was 15 or 16, started crying right in the middle of class and ran to the office to see a counselor. I talked about some of what was going on (without going through the most secretive stuff so that my mom wouldn't be mad at me), and when she asked if I wanted to let my mother know how I felt, I honestly believed this would help and my mom would do the right thing. My mom came into the school, smiling and looking all right. As we got into the car, I looked expectantly towards her to talk to me and help me. Her face darkened as we went down the road, and then she turned to me and spat out, ""How dare you do that to me!"" She attacked me all the way home and then as soon as we got home, she went into my brothers' room and said, ""Guess what your sister said about us?"" and they all literally came into my room and surrounded me, mobbing me, yelling at me for daring to go to a counselor. And this wasn't the first time they'd done that to me - when my mother used me as a child around 7 or 8 as a weapon against my father to lie about him, the rest of my family did the same thing to me. I couldn't go to anyone for help, was even afraid to CRY in that household... and yet nobody knew what was going on outside the house because the only thing you saw when you saw me was a girl who kept her head down and didn't talk to others to the point where she'd actually dissociate if others TRIED to talk to her. Those chest pains were my body finally responding to what that evil woman did to me. Today, I still deal with phantom pains and issues, calling into work more than I should for issues that are probably more related to this than to anything I've caught. A therapist assessed me as having PTSD. It's amazing how I deal with these things and cannot tell others, ""It's because my body is on high alert all the time from childhood issues"".","Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Trauma"

Even my own son took to the pratice of abusing me and ysing my.parents to do so as well as his Father after my parents past away... So I decided to give up and leave my home town forever...

I grew up loving others giving and treating everyone the way i wished to be treated... I spent my adult life trying to make a difference in the community fir change to prevent and stop the maddness create jobs to help better the lifes of the community and still all i git was the same used and abused the bblamed and lastely they play their vctim card...  Ive lost more finaically tham any of them has ever seen or will ever have trying to make a change for the better of the community and be love fir a change to no avail... So now i move on...

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Growing up in an house where domestic violence was cyclical and systematic, I developed complex PTSD and developed an auto-immune disorder. The physical and behavioral outcomes that were a result of the trauma (i.e. acting out, poor school performance, committing self harm, always feeling ill and unable to perform according to my parents’ demands) were largely ignored or severely shamed and violently punished by my family. It wasn’t until I almost took my life when I was fifteen that my parents were forced to seek psychological treatment to address my suicidal tendencies. 

I spent the rest of my adolescence in and out of emergency care centers as the violence and abuse continued to push me into committing self harm and experiencing mental breakdowns. Back then, I had started my ten year long journey to treat my symptoms of depression, crippling anxiety, insomnia, suicidality and inability to focus. In ALL that time, despite the fact that I frequently brought it up, my traumatic and toxic environment wasn’t EVER considered or taken as a serious catalyst for the symptoms or behaviors I was exhibiting. I was diagnosed with ADHD, Generalized Anxiety disorder, Social anxiety disorder, severe Depression, Insomnia, etc. Psychiatrist after psychiatrist threw ADHD medicine at it, anti depressants, anti anxiety, benzodiazepines, sedatives, you name it; while counselor after counselor put me into “classes” for my many diagnoses. Unsurprisingly nothing worked and eventually I was stamped with Borderline Personality Disorder. The care providers then started to blame me for not “committing myself enough” to their treatment and therefore not responding “successfully enough” to satisfy them. All that time I was treated by for profit insurance companies, five years in which were at Kaiser Permanente. 

It wasn’t until I was 25 when I found a non-profit organization that truly helped me. There, I FINALLY found a counselor who recognized the violence and abuse that my family had and still were inflicting upon me at the time. She gave me the courage to cut ties with them and focus on healing. I have recently been diagnosed with Psoriatic Arthritis, an genetic auto immune disorder that is known to be expressed when triggered by physical or emotional trauma and stress. 

Knowing what I know now, it’s super obvious that the way our healthcare system addresses domestic violence and abuse is a joke. These things have been around since the dawn of man but the vast majority of mainstream healthcare professionals can’t figure out that the physical and emotional welfare of children and adults alike are compromised when exposed to short or long time abuse. It doesn’t take a doctoral degree to figure that out. Unfortunately, I see this process repeated with children of abusive parents to this day. Several of my younger cousins have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder as the abusive and violent legacy is perpetuated upon the next generation.

Healthcare professionals need to put down their “emotional wellness” checklists and learn how to connect with the vulnerable human beings they’re treating. The blame rests solely upon the failings of our current healthcare system that doesn’t want to take into account the immense influence that violence has in people’s lives.","Physical & Mental Wellness, Mental Health - Trauma, Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Anxiety, Mental Health - Depression, Recovery & Self Care"

The major one which has not been diagnosed even after 10 years of doctors, regular fevers, abnormal tests. severe muscle and joint pain, severe nausea regularly,  Im not faking but the doctors cant figure out the main problem with me. They keep finding other conditions. Too many too remember because the names are big. Could my health problems be because of being personally abused, seeing my mom being abused, having guns pointed at me, chased with said guns, both parents having schizophrenia, both parents addicted to drugs and alcohol (different drug preferences) and eventually my dad killing himself at 9,  and my mom ending up in a mental hospital so she had to give custody to my grandma at 10??

Truth be told I unpacked my demons by facing my truth and understanding and knowing with full belief that it’s not my fault and never was my fault. What people did to me was a projection of their own fears and they was doing to me what was being done to them. They didn’t know any better and if they did know better they did not care at the time of doing it. They were fighting to get their own power back. 

When I decided to get my life together I used church to get my heart right with God and once I was tired of the church and received healing I started meditating and began to focus on my truths. I was honest with myself and I’m still honest with myself and my heart really began to grow and be free! everything negative begin to be reversed to a positive. I’ve forgiven my Mom, my dad and my abusers. I’ve even forgiven myself. Today I am happy !

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Hope I can leave this here: I hope at least one young adult or anyone can read this. I was a product of child abuse from a single mother with mental issues... who had little income and education. But that's not why I'm posting this message. I'm posting this because I want ANYone who has had issues with mental illness no matter how they got it. True, Nadine has a point with childhood trauma and how it affects one's health and one's future. But again, I want ""you"" to read this message...and I hope this can help someone who's dealt with their own personal issues to stay or become independent. This message was initially posted on another channel by a business entrepreneur (Mr. Kiyosaki)...sorry I forgot his channel just now. 

 I was to inherit a house from a dead beat dad who was never in our lives and never paid child support. It would've been the only asset I'd ever have to invest in. Like many college grads, I've been poor with nothing but a little savings. I hustle for a living in an industry that no one ever would go to school for or  would want to. 
This house that I ""was"" to inherit actually belonged to my our uncle who was once a LA doctor right up until he died of a stroke or something of that nature in 2017. In 2018 my father ended up getting stage 4 cancer but was supposed to get all assets from his dead brother since he had no will himself by the time he died in 2017. Our father had no real assets for himself other than a ""mortgage."" Initially in our father's will my sister was to receive a small trailer in AK that was also owned by our late uncle. I felt bad for her since she was the only one among myself and our mother whoever had any kind of relationship with this guy. I told her I'd share everything with her, she texted back to me ""Ok."" She would even tell me that ""we deserve that money...."" 
In Dec of 2018,  I ended up ruminating over feelings over my mother being by herself in taking care of myself and my sister. So...basically in Dec 2018, for some unGodly crazy reason,  I  cursed and berated my dead beat dad out via text. I didn't even care about my part in the will.  In Feb 2019, my father amended his will and thus gave the house to my sister. In Feb 2019, I flew from NYC and went to care for our mother who just got out of back surgery in GA. My sister would then tell me that I was out of our father's will and that I didn't deserve that money. In a few days after my visit, my mother would die in front of me and my nephew a few days later while my sister had been going to FL to see her ""daddy"" and was about to take a cruise w/ one her daughters.  I couldn't effing believe it. My mom was dead. Our father would die exactly a month later. I'd later learn that my sister had my mother sign everything over to her on the day of her surgery 2/7/19...even if my youngest nephew and I were supposed to inherit one of my mom's properties.  My point isn't about having a sociopath for a sister who constantly depended on and manipulated and stole money from our mother and tried to scheme money from a dead beat dad who didn't even like her. My point is:  kiss as much butt...even if it's your dead beat parent. For me, I am doomed. I'm doomed to poverty and to death by poverty. It's a pathetic, poor person's mentality as mention by Mr. Kiyosaki,  sure....but I am 47 y/o with an OCD that conquered me and gave me this pathetic mentality. I let my issues rule my world, my life and my independence.  Young people, take this man's advice: Do whatever you can to become independent (w/o becoming a prostitute or hurting others) and then do what you love later. Second point: DO IT NOW. As for those who feel they need emotional help, try to get help right away, don't be ashamed.... and stay the course even if you have to change therapists who may be as sociopathic as your relatives. Never give up on yourself. I'm a bit of a cynical hypocrite yes, but I'm no longer young while being realistic.

https://www.ncjfcj.org/sites/default/files/Finding%20Your%20ACE%20Score.pdf

I scored an 8 out of 10. The sad part is that I suffered from the majority of those 8 ACE’s all at the same time, all throughout my childhood. While I was starting to heal from a car accident, and after my doctors performed every test imaginable (for my symptoms), I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, among other things. I had more than one doctor tell me that my body was in a _constant_ state of fight-or-flight. I didn’t _fully understand_ the ramifications of that until I watched this video. I now feel like I need to be even more diligent about my healthcare, and seek treatment, remedies, etc. in order to ward off some of the diseases Dr. Burke spoke of. I guess it’s time to do some research on this subject, _especially_ with my high ACE score as a child, _and the fact_ that my body was again in fight-or-flight mode for years as an adult.

On a side note, my MVA was on 9/11/2002. Back then I insisted to my doctors that my fibromyalgia was brought on by my MVA. *EVERY DOCTOR* _insisted_ that wasn’t the case. But I knew that I was healthy as a horse (except asthma) before the accident. Only recently have doctors understood that illness and injury *CAN* bring on “sudden onset fibro”. They’ve also discovered that injury-related fibro patients who link their ailment to an MVA, _especially those with a neck injury,_ are more likely to have sudden onset fibro that comes on quicker, stronger, and more powerful.
Yup! That’s what I said from the start about my personal fibro, yet not a single Dr. would even consider it. Honestly, I *hate* when doctors don’t trust you when you’re talking about what’s “normal” in your own body! 😡 
I also believe there is some type of correlation between everything that occurred as a result of my MVA and me being diagnosed with hypothyroidism so soon afterward. The jury is still out on that one in the medical field though.",other

https://www.ncjfcj.org/sites/default/files/Finding%20Your%20ACE%20Score.pdf

As a 40 something year old woman who suffered several ACE’s through the majority of my childhood, I’m interested in learning if there’s anything I can do to change my risk of the outcomes Dr. Burke spoke of. I know one thing that has already helped reduce my risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and many more health benefits.  I have the proof in black and white, in the form of blood work during my last hospital stay, and the proof in my clinical symptoms, allowing me to stop medications I’ve been on for *years* as well as reduced inflammation in my body. I also lost that last 15 pounds that’s always the hardest to lose. As a bonus, it’s also greatly improved my mental health. Curious what this “magic” anecdote is yet? Veganism. That’s it. My blood work changed so drastically in 6 short months that my doctor brought in 5 of his colleagues to ask me what I was doing differently. They were most interested in my low cholesterol. I never had high cholesterol anyway (as a matter of fact, it’s always been ideal), that made the reduction they saw even more noteworthy. I was told they had never seen anyone with as low cholesterol as mine. They probably had a combined experience of 100+ years, yet they had NEVER seen anyone with my cholesterol levels. If that doesn’t prove veganism works, idk what would.🌱

95ovIJ3dsNk,"From the research I’ve done I think there’s one enormous reason that childhood trauma is not being addressed properly: to fix the root of the problem, we need to bring back the traditional, nuclear, married mom-and-dad family as the norm.
There are so many studies on this I can’t cite them all here — just google “child abuse and single-parent households” if you’re interested — but it is overwhelmingly clear that the absolute healthiest, safest environment for kids to grow up in is the traditional mother-and-father marriage family unit. Any other situation is many times more dangerous and unhealthy.

But this of course is “old-fashioned”, “exclusive”, and “unwoke”. So until THAT root issue is addressed, the problem of increasing childhood trauma will not go away.",Mental Health - Trauma

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Childhood trauma begins in the womb, caused by stress and drugs on the part of the mother. But established medical science and Big Pharma have the solution.  Bleed the patients to rid the bodies of evil demons.  ACE: Adverse Childhood Experiences. Most parents are not qualified to be parents. Most people must not be permitted to reproduce? Eugenics, anyone?  What social classes are reproducing the most?  ACE will eventually result in social collapse. 

The pre-frontal cortex for executive functions doesn't mature until one is in his mid-twenties. This part of the brain controls or restricts irrational or destructive behavior which is characteristic of teen behavior.

When one is under stress (running from a bear), the blood and energy that promote health repair and maintenance goes into the ""fight or flight mode"". One under constant physical or emotional stress or trauma is depriving the body of the energy to maintain health. This energy can't be in both places at the same time. Hence, illness results. What Dr. Harris says, is supported by the findings of Drs. Joe Dispenza and Bruce Lipton.

So long as we hold onto highly individualistic materialism, we are implicitly de-prioritizing the health of our children - and thus our future.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I believe the stress response can also be activated by social media. As a therapist working with young people, so much of their lives are online and behind the screen a new category of stress trigger should be added to the questionaire.   Things like negative comments, trolls, cyberbullying, etc all trigger this in young people and children.  There is a definite affect on their perception of relationships and reality.    So even some children who do not have family related trauma or adverse experiences may have ACEs.     Also families split because of geography, acrimonious divorce, unemployment or financial adversity are also triggers for ACEs as they can cause difficulties in parental behaviour or mental health which can have an adverse affect on children and young people in the household.
Consider the fact that from birth to 3 years is the first great development of the human brain, but that from the onset of puberty, adolescence marks the next great stage of brain development when repeated behaviours or experiences create connections.   On top of that young people have no ability to put any experience into context the way an adult might be able to, and must find a way to understand and interpret and internalise all of their experiences.

It didn't take me long to realize that showing any negative emotions or asking for help would mean I would be punished. 
Now I'm 18 and still absolutely refuse to ask for help or to talk about my emotions. I've gone to therapy and lied the whole time just telling my therapist what she wanted to hear.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"You nailed it, Dr. Harris.  I was treated by a functional medicine Dr based on his full understanding of failure or dysfunction of the HPA axis.  I was diagnosed with fibro, in 2013, by three Drs.  One Dr. was a rheumatologist at Duke University.  The functional medicine Dr who treated me stated he had never seen cortisol levels as low as mine, the lowest being a “1.”  He helped heal my adrenal glands and had me try several other supplements to address my symptoms.  At the end of the 6 month treatment, which insurance did not cover and cost $4,000.00,  I was left with the same level of pain.  I guess he had not treated a patient with such an extreme case of fibromyalgia?  I thought since he understood the source of the illness, he would have a treatment protocol which would heal all my symptoms.  His response to my disappointment and remaining pain was, “I’m sorry you feel that way.”  When a Dr states he or she understands the cause of my illness and firmly believes he or she can heal me, but does not, how else am I to feel?  This Dr completely invalidated my suffering.  I suffered for 5 more years until I found an alternative healing modality which would root out the source of trauma.  A QHHT session triggered the beginning of healing for me.  Western medicine has yet to understand how crucial the HPA axis is in regard to treating fibromyalgia, ME/ CFS and possibly several other chronic illnesses.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Wow that talk hit home for me, it was awesome. I suffered at the hand of my father. He emotionally and verbally abused me . There were times when he physically abused me too, but the worst abuse was the sexual abuse. I was a sick kid. I always got colds and the flu, because of that I was off school quite often, my mum would look after me, she was a great mum, she protected me from my father. When I was 11 years old my mother died and I was left with the monster who had all the power and he used every bit of it against me. The trauma made me sick, I got every bug that was out there, I got asthma and my school work was shocking, I didn’t see why I needed to learn about people landing on the moon or algebra when I was going home to the monster. 
Hearing that kids that are abused get sicker than most, that was a wonderful eye opener for me. The thing that made me different from other kids, and I hate this difference because it still effects me today, is my  economic state, my father was rich, I went to the best private schools and I even got to go to a private boarding school which was absolutely wonderful and a dream come true until the monster would ring me and make me feel so guilty to be away from him and not looking after him. No one picked up on the abuse, I was even told by a teacher that I was so lucky to be in such a loving family because my dad sent me to a private school even though my mother had passed away, she thought my dad was great. My long winded post (sorry about that) is that there are people in my situation that are falling through the cracks because they come from a wealthy family, please don’t forget about people like me. I know that most of the attention needs to be on the kids that are struggling to make ends meet, I’m not saying they are less important than me because they arent they need the help and understanding more than me  what I’m trying to say is abuse happens in all groups in society, some a lot more than others and they need the care offered because they are desperate. 
I guess what I’m saying is the silent killer is out there is many groups of society. I tried to speak out once and I was laughed at and told to keep my lies to myself.

My dad was military, and he wAs gone a lot, and she hid it well. But he got statements from neighbors, friends, etc for the courts and brought us home. Her mentality is that she doesn't think she was a bad mom, I think that she has a mental disorder, I've seen it more as I got older. I got a BA in Psychology and a BA in Early Childhood Development and have studied almost every different mental disorder, and my mom defiantly has at least two.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Just took the test and (unsurprisingly) got a score of 7. Even though I’ve mostly given up on ever being mentally stable, I decided to look into possible treatment because honestly? These raging and never ending headaches are killing me and I’d love a way to get rid of them. Yet, even while spending an hour looking and flipping through page after page, no one really knows. They recommend therapy and EMDR, even writing out your feelings to just get it out. But what if you’ve done all of these things, are currently doing these things, and yet still find yourself no better? The only difference I have seen in who I was when I was 13 before I started therapy and now being 18 and five years into therapy, is that I’ve lost all hope and have learned how to keep my anger more subtle than before. But nothing has gone away. I no longer attempt suicide because I know my current health problems will either kill me, new ones will develop and kill me, or another human being will kill me. I’ve accepted that I probably won’t make it/live past 50, and did so when I was 15. I’ve given up on my mother ever being a better person, getting her mental issues worked out, and no matter how much it hurts, I know I’ll never hear her admit how much she really hurt me. All she will ever do is blame it on me and my brother that raped me. It will never be her fault. It will always be someone else’s fault. And it’s usually my fault. Like most things that occur in the lives of those around me. I’m annoying, I’m overbearing, I’m inconsiderate, I’m too much, I’m selfish, I’m in the way, I’m unwanted. That’s how it’s been since I was 3, that’s how it was when I was 13, that’s how it is now, 18. I will always be the one to blame, and while in many instances I am truly and honestly the fault for many arguments and am on many occasions too aggressive and impulsive, I am the only one ever at fault.

OR they had to deal with a bigger bear in their childhood and being ""better"" than their parents is equivalent to being a good parent. Just being better doesn't mean that you're doing a good job, that you aren't still making a huge negative impact. I mean less abusive is still abusive.


This is why I'm nearing the point of never wanting to have kids (not that I can anyways on my own). With all of my own mental issues and my own childhood trauma, I really don't want to have the responsibility of possibly destroying another beings life because I don't know what I will unintentionally inflict on them. I know that's probably giving myself too much credit as there will be another parent at risk of the same thing, so at the very least it won't be ALL my fault, however, I have learned from experience trauma does not require two parents, one is always enough.


BTW I think that also sums up why the birth rate has been dropping in the US, because I think many young adults are realizing they may not want to pass on their own trauma. idk, I can only hope.",Mental Health - Trauma

He said he didn't want any children. Now how is that for just a little information on what I had to endure as a child growing up. So I truly understand the anxiety.

Over a decade, various therapist, and programs.   THAT is how I paid for the abuse.  I had no way to understand my behavior in relationships...until I got Help

But my Sister, who did not want to deal with the issues and seek Help  - turned to alcohol, drugs, and repeatedly bad behavior.   She is now divorced and has no contact with her Children.  The PROBELM was repeated in her own life - with her own children.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I am 21 years old. A few weeks after I was born, my mom almost died from the staff infection she got in the hospital. (Drs kept telling her it was the flu) I was plagued with nightmares my whole childhood of my mother dying, but I did not know that happened until recently. I am easily traumatized. I was socially awkward and bullied to the extreme my whole life. Now at 21, I have had to drop out of college twice now because of, get ready: Hoshimotos thyroid disease, endometriosis (emergency surgery and removal of killed ovary), PCOS and now adrenal fatigue. My hormones were so off that I sweat through a 2 inch mattress pad every night down to the mattress. Throwing up in my sleep because of the loss of electrolytes. 2 days ago I had a MRI biopsy of a mysterious mass in my breast. Considering much of my trauma happened during puberty, I wonder if this contributed to my hormonal and reproductive health. I spent my highschool years in mental institutions for suicide attempts and self harm. I'm sorry for the long comment, I just hope someone out there relates to this. I may have healed alot mentally (still have a ways to go) but my health has prevented me from starting my life like all my friends are.

The adrenal glands regulate your blood pressure, blood sugar, cortisol & adrenaline levels and over 50 hormones!! They are a HUGE DEAL!! but are over looked by pretty much every doctor. The doctor that specializes in adrenal gland issue is a Endocrinologist this is the expert you want to go to. Also look up “Adrenal fatigue’ on the net & you tube this is most like the mass population issue. It’s not just toxic relationship that affect the adrenal glands but, also poor diet, lack of sleep, too much too little exercise, daily stress, hormonal imbalance (even for men), alcohol & drugs (illegal or Rx) etc etc.

Look up Adrenal fatigue.

One of the best ways to heal your adrenal glands is eating a very very clean healthy diet with lots & lots of vegetables. Also, possible hormonal balancing, plenty of rest & relaxation, sleep. 

Google:  ""Super Juice me Documentary you tube”...this is one of the most powerful FREE documentaries I have ever watched, this should be mandatory for everyone.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Well said and I would like to share my experience with a lifetime of dealing with CPTSD, called ComplexPTSD because the triggers are emotional rather than outside of ourselves.  At 65 years old I was still searching for healing of my childhood trauma and through a wise counselor was transferred to a trauma therapist who used EMDR therapy along with Forward Facing Therapy.  In 5 sessions I found healing and release from the triggers that had plagued my life from infancy.  I can’t express the joy and strength that has filled my whole being since then.  I no longer freeze in fear if someone close to me raises their voice or becomes angry.  I have the power to stand up and take care of myself when needed or even to walk away rather than stay in a situation that is unhealthy for all involved.   I don’t think we have to accept that we are doomed to health problems due to our traumatic childhood because there is also research that shows that the areas of the brain the doctor mentioned repair and heal when the trauma is removed.  My father had an extremely traumatic childhood and had his issues but lived to 94 years old.  He made good choices regarding his physical health but died of Alzheimer’s.  So I encourage you all to shake loose from the idea that you can’t overcome a hard life because you can choose to look for healing, don’t give in to despair because you were made to survive and thrive by the grace of God.","Mental Health - Therapy, Recovery & Self Care, Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Trauma"

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Nadine Burke Harris explains what I recognized as I was raising my children. Toxic stress, parental abuse,  neglect and other adverse childhood experiences cause health and learning problems. I acknowledged this and I became a better parent that did not contribute to family stress. Then I recognized the harder to pinpoint constant neglect, coercive control and undermining of my ex husband. I tried to educate him and get him to see the problem. He refused to acknowledge a problem or change. For two years, from 2006, until 2008, I gently pointed out to him every time he was neglecting, undermining, or coercievely abusing the children. 

When he refused to change, I asked for a divorce in 2008. At that time he threatened to kill me and the children if I left and got 50% custody. I wanted to get 50% custody to show him the difference of no video games and supporting the children in public school because homeschool wasn't working. The difference of healthy food, medical care and no stress or adverse childhood experiences. I wanted my children to receive counseling, in a religious environment where no counseling was allowed. 

In my foolishness, I did not realise that the counselors, judges, court system, domestic violence shelter and police would all work against me as I tried to get help for me and my children. The inside world of domestic violence is very isolating. To bravely seek outside help only to be betrayed, beaten by the police, banned from the domestic violence shelters, railroaded by corrupt lawyers and judges and lose all contact with my children, is proof that the system has NO GRASP at all of the ACE studies and no support for what I was trying to do to help my children.",Mental Health - Stress

I met the Savior, Jesus, when I was just shy of my 25th birthday, and everything began to clear up after that.  For the next 8 years I was on a journey of major inner healing, just as I spent time getting to know Him.  By the end of 8 years the big giants were slain in my heart so I could be a functional human man; alas, it's a lifelong journey into wholeness and healing, but knowing Him makes it worth it all.

What the farmers have to do to feed the cattle. Is feed them corn laced with high doses of antibiotics. Antibiotics is not what makes cattle bigger what they're doing is preventing the cattle from getting e-coli because they are eating their own feces they shovel the corn into the aci's by driving through The Herd  in a pickup truck and they begin shoveling antibiotic laced corn on to the feces.

Several are getting Kickbacks specially doctors trying to get you to get Hepatitis A and B vaccination. I had a big fight with my GI doctor about this. If you look it up the possible side effects are worse than the disease. Much worse straight it is better to get Hepatitis A or B then to get the side effects from the vaccination. We are all being lied to by the FDA and the pharmaceutical companies. Many things that we consume that the FDA has allowed us to consume. Ethylene glycol it's the sweetener in non-caloric alcohol is like Fireball Cinnamon whiskey from Canada. And also rapeseed oil most of you know it as canola oil. Ray seed is a poisonous plant and is sold in the UK under the name canola oil as a poison a pesticide. Yet the FDA allows us to consume it on a daily basis every fast food restaurant in the United States uses canola oil. Another Canadian products Canadian Oil is what canola oil stand for. Also never eat honey from the problem is. All doctors have been lied to the entire career by pharmaceutical the problem is. All doctors have been lied to the entire career by pharmaceutical companies and a publication that contains pharmaceutical add is a lie and a manipulation for the doctors they are two trusting of the pharmaceutical companies.

The shame is that in the same country, many care givers empolyed their skills - and exported worldwide the scheme - to destroy a science that had said that personal history impacts personal developpement at a point that turns to major health problems ever since 1920. Almost every American MD, psychiatrists on top, thought it was a better idea to ignore trauma and treat just the symptoms for almost 60 years. They intellectually validated the pharmaceutical labs army in their industrious mining of psychoanalysis and global clinical understandig of humans.

Living in an environment surrounded by the parents' outdated opinions about parenting (upbringing) like Vietnam, I was desperating many times about trying to convince my mother to give me a mental health check, though it's just a normal request, right? I'm still curious why she denied it immediately when I ask, maybe she didn't want others to think that I was having problem of psychiatry?
After watched this video, I've searched on Google to have an ACEs online test. My score is 6 and as Dr.Burke presented, it's high (4 or more). I got both torture of physical and psychical. The 2 most typical things are stroke (even knife using) and sexual actions (actually have had oral and vaginal intercourse). He (everyone calls him ''my dad'') kept hitting me since I was 3 until 13 (now I'm 14), kept doing sexual actions for 3-4 days when I was in the stage of 10 to 11. I don't understand why didn't I denounced him?  I was scared. He even held my hand and put it inside his underwear. His older sister (my aunt) and other adults who knew that, kept shout out to me that maybe I was mistakenly thought or dreamed about it (what? I didn't even watch adult videos, please), others said he thought it was my mom, and mostly said that he just taught me about sexual problem that may happen to me some years later so I could protect myself. My mom's thoughts combined them all. 
Dear Dr. Burke, I really appreciate your presentation, wanna say thanks to you so much, it helps me to figure out all the problems that I'm having. I wish if I could watch it sooner..

My very first memories is being killed in a past life, getting my face shoved in a metal fan and getting beaten and sprayed outside with a water hose. I was abused by my adopted mother who is my blood aunt. She herself was very mentally I'll and had psychotic episodes. If I got in any sort of trouble in school, she had many different ways to enact punishment on me. Hitting me with the metal end of a flyswatter, beating me with a leather belt, hitting me with hangers, making me stand in a corner all day (It got to the point where she'd make me stand there for a month just for her enjoyment); She had cheated and divorced my adopted dad and kept me. She ended up marrying the guy she cheated on my dad with and he would molest me in my sleep. I'd wake up and he'd run out of my room. I was forced to travel to different states a lot, went homeless a few times, and every school I went to, I was bullied harshly because I didn't know how to be normal anymore. My childhood with my dad had been taken away from me and my adopted mom didn't want me to have friends or do anything fun. I was always locked up in my room or forced to stay outside in the yard all day. It really sucks. All I wanted and all I still want is someone to love me, but when I was 17, I was broken up with by this guy named James. I had loved him with all my heart and he was my healing, my comfort and my peace. But he broke up with me, wouldn't tell me why, and was sorry. I cried for a week straight. I've had many suicidal attempts and have almost died many times, but something inside me makes me hesitate. It's a feeling in the stomach area, most likely fear. I know I don't want to really die, I fear death, but at the same time, it's the only escape from the pain and from the memories that haunt you.

So I got it into my head that I couldn't do what I wanted to without affecting other people adversely. If my parents weren't holding me back, I was inhibiting myself. Rubbish self esteem. Always deferring to others. Struggled with depression from birth when I made my first enemy emerging from my mother's womb - my father.

At least, this was my experience as a mixed child adopted into an upper middle class white home. The abuse was accepted (e.g. my being stabbed in my sleep at age 3 after her biological daughter died; my mother's refusal to take me to the hospital seven years later when I was suffering from appendicitis, and just barely making it to the ER before it ruptured... She's wanted me dead since I was 3), and nobody saw any reason to call the authorities because I was ""better off"" in the home with money (semi true) than being placed in ostensibly a lower class minority foster home.

Later the beatings stopped, but there was a lot of dominance in the house, he was always cold, always yelling, always getting angry, never there for me. If I would try to rebel, he would put me down by yelling and showing dominance. I had no voice in the house to say how I really felt about him.

All religions used to include forms of trauma to affect psychological change toward deeper maturity.

It's ""common sense"" that If you do drugs or become an alcoholic you are more likely to die from those things than someone who does not do them at all. Someone who is abused is more likely to turn to drugs and alcohol or become suicidal and is therefore more likely to die from alcohol or suicide than someone who hasn't been abused. She's not saying anything we haven't already known.  I will also state a known guard against this: Prevention is key. Good parenting is key. Involved parenting and intervention is key. Often people just need someone who truly cares about them and loves them enough to be there for them and steer them in the right direction. How about we work on our relationships with others and stop being selfish, egotistical bastards. That alone might get people to help people who are literally crying out for help. By the way, call your family and check to see how your brothers and sisters are doing. If they're not doing well then help them and be involved. Same goes for your friends too. If you're strong right now then help someone who is at a low point. Don't just let people go down the drain while you parade on your high horse.

Yeah... I'm probably a 4 or higher.

It's not normal to constantly monitor where people are and try to soothe them when they are angry. My wonderful patient roommates gently showed me how people treat each other. They showed me what respect looks like. 

They showed me what kind of behavior I am entitled to. I am entitled to wash my dishes while someone is using the microwave. I am entitled to using the stove when someone is using the toaster. I am entitled to cleaning the kitchen without being yelled at. I am entitled to make mistakes and be gently told what I did wrong and how to improve for next time. I am entitled to praise once in a while. I am entitled to having civil conversations. These are things that happen in a healthy happy household and I didn't know it. I had so many maladaptive behaviors. And when I go home I sometimes forget what the tyrannical rules are.

His wife, an emotional abuser parent figure told me I wasn't telling the truth when i finally snapped on the male abuser for bizarrely going on a rant at 2 am in my room, falsely accusing me of multiple attempts of raping  him. after 4 years of dealing with him and feeling the constant feeling of drowning in air, i had conveniently turned 18 and moved out by myself and never looked back. Unfortunately the brief period of freedom joy faded as the familiar feeling of dread from a young age had reappeared again, only this time worsening over the course of my next 4 years. Im 22 now, This began with this abuser when i had just turned 14. I love myself but cannot seem to come to peace with my past trauma that feels more complex as time goes on. I cant get out of bed most days and havent for over a year. Thats when it turned into a constant rather than a temporary depression as i had once experienced around the age of 11. I can not understand how anyone can have firsthand experience of being abused, and still go on to abuse. This is and will never be an acceptable valid reason to me. I dont care how severe your past trauma is, a person who knowingly disregards another victims entire future of having a stable mental state, to have an outlet, will always be the lowest form of person to me. They choose to be weak to self-gratify. You can not convince me ever that past abuse is any form of valid excuse for the abusee to go on to be the abuser.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Excellent.  I would add that a huge portion, maybe more than half of these ACEs are inflicted by other children.  And many of the perpetrator children did _not_ themselves have abusive parents.  That's unpalatable for people to accept; that the children are at fault, but they are.  We are all born narcissists.  It takes conscientious pro-active parenting or some cultural tradition that achieves the same effect without understanding, to make us _not_ narcissistic assholes when we grow up.  An absence of abuse is not sufficient.  Morality is a social code of behavior that overlaps with, but is superimposed on top of, instinctive behavior.  For that superimposition to take place, it has to be taught.
   That means the parents/society needs to either be part of a system of cultural practices that naturally instills by example the necessary moral lessons upon the child with or without understanding, OR(since we are not in such a society) parents need to be educated on child-rearing.


Unfortunately there's a catch.  Another uncomfortable reality.  People at the low end of the IQ spectrum sometimes can't learn and internalize those necessary concepts.  And that's a problem of capitalism.  Don't get me wrong; it's the best system going. But it is inherently adverse.  And adversity begets adversity.  Most people don't feel like part of a team, though we evolved to be in a team environment.  Capitalism throws every dog to the mercy of the most capable wolves.
   We have a choice to make; we've been dithering about it for a long time.  Do we cannibalize the weak, in keeping with the reptilian evolutionary condition?  Or do we care for the weak?
   If we're going to care for the weak, we're going to need to implement UBI, Universal Basic Income.  We can still be capitalist.  But relying on churches for charity in an age of secularization no longer suffices.  And our current welfare net is broken beyond believe, with negative incentive structures and high costs.  When people calculate the costs of UBI, they do _not_ take ACEs into account.  They do not factor in the savings to society that will result from a less traumatized population.  I think that's a _huge_ factor.
   I think that replacing the current welfare systems with UBI, switching out the negative incentive structure for a positive one(too much to go into here), not to mention the massive potential reduction in administrative costs(also too much to go into), would result in a net savings.  It would cost less than the current model.
  It's one of the two keys to fixing society.  The other is more difficult; we need some grand vision to give our lives and endeavors purpose and meaning and a sense of social binding.  But first we need to stop the abuse by becoming, at least financially, something closer to a family.   That does _not_ mean equality of resource distribution; not even close.  If one brother becomes a millionaire, he doesn't split is earnings with his troubled brother.  But he does keep his brother from dying, if he can, and from too much suffering.  Because he cares.  We are our brothers' keepers.  That's family.  It's the tribal model we evolved for and in, but with a much larger tribe.
   And if we _don't_ do that, if we don't 'keep' each other, if we throw each other to the wolves of a purely merit-based resource distribution, we perpetuate the cycle of abuse and ACEs.  It's not _caused_ by drugs or alcohol, nor even low IQ by itself.  It's caused by hopelessness and helplessness, misery, frustration, and the feeling of alienation, of unlove, disenfranchisement, ostracism.  UBI fixes most of that, by changing the bedrock of the psychological circumstance in one mighty stroke.  It will turn pariahs into participants, menaces into mensch.  When you change people's emotions, you change how they behave.",Mental Health - Trauma

I went from a ""normal"" child, to an obese child, from an A student, to a C student, I started staying in my room more, going out less. Then I started going out more, staying home less. Then I took an overdose of pills at 12. Not once do I remember therapy in these early years. Which should've been mandatory.  Someone saw this, and closed their eyes to it. As an adult, I still suffer from severe anxiety and depression.  Emotional eating. Overachieving until burnout. After years of therapy,  I still cannot break the cycle.

Doctors are not saviors, even less so those who prescribe pills as salvation. She claims at the end that what is preventing mass awareness of the link between childhood trauma and illness later in life is the reluctance to confront our own personal tragedies. That may be part of it; but I suspect the greater cause lies with the medical industry's (as yet) inability to truly help such people. Yes, there are psychiatrists and anti-depressants, but these only scratch the surface of trauma and may engender problems of their own (side effects, addiction & dependency, etc.). 

What may benefit someone who has suffered childhood abuse (and I hesitate to say ""cure"" because we never rid ourselves of its legacy but learn to live in spite of it): therapy, religion, spirituality, art, life experiences, introspection & reflection, mentorship, friendship, rewarding work and activity, to name a few.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"THANK YOU SO MUCH. As a child coming in this life i came with the awareness the realization that i had memory of many past lives, and that i came in this journey, in this current life i choze to experience this Earth and live my purpose as an individual soul. Trying to communicate this with my current family here at the start seemed like a miracle to them, but what then was dealt with jealousy cz of other members in the family- brother siblings and others, was dealt as a confusion, as a mistake, as something that did not fit into the family, i needed maybe much more attention and care that was thought as ''okay giving'' from my family. I lived most part of my life in isolation- despair, feeling like a burden, not belonging, dealing with neglect, punishment to change who i was, and conform in the idea of what was okay for my society and family standards of what was considered okay. There is a phrase i put on my childhood home room for others to see in the hope of that maybe one i will be understood, not that it matters now since i moved into a different life, i put: ''You met her as a flower, and instead of nurturing her and growing her, you cut her and put her in your vase for everyone to see''. Sometimes is quite insane what we do to our children and, we dont understand until sometimes is too late for them.  After dealing with a very different life caused by rejecting myself in order to survive, i left my families home to go live in a country i had no idea about and figure things out, the trauma went too deep it developed into cancer Leukemia eating me inside out, i developed dengue fever which is one of the most deadliest fevers in the world like a virus that breaks the bones and lets the organs bleed from the inside out, later i lost all my senses, from seeing to hearing being able to eat, breath- severe asthma, multiple sclerosis having my body all paralysed one piece at a time every day and leading to a stroke and a heart attack, which caused my heart to stop for whole 6 hours as i went inside to what people now call a death experience, what i now call taking the inner journey of self understanding- self awareness, the inner final journey, as we come with ourselves, we go back to ourselves.  In the meantime when i moved to this city this strange country i had no idea about, i tried to understand where all this was coming from and at that time, not i am aware about the stress, about the hormones and what this all causes to the body, but back then i didnt. So i was arguing with parents trying to explain to them that my pain is coming from deep trauma caused in my childhood, and still they didnt understand, i was shamed for it, neglected unheard and blamed back. Undergoing the journey of death- and rebirth, i am now blessed to have deep energetic awakenings everyday, putting my life back in pieces and peace staying away from people who dont get who i am, staying in my core, teaching others how to regain themselves in all levels of reality understanding soul and body and how this all links back to the physical body and in dealing with where we are as individuals instead of running away from our situation. Having my business Eternal Gaias with amazing teachings has created the movement i was always searching for in my life, as my life has now turned into what i finally call home, finally.  We are indeed the movement, and i thank Nadine for saying what she said about the body.  Still recovering from all of this, yet the journey is much easy now, much healthier thanks to these realizations.  For those who want to follow my work is Eternal Gaias on Facebook, and for those who want to check out what i do and join this miraculous journey you are always free to send me a message from there.

Sometimes she totally belittled the problem or she acted in a way that made things worst. There was no time ever when I told her something and she didn't make me regret I talked. I have anxiety problems and depression (while she got out of hers). It took me years before telling her about it, and she said she would help me, but she actually ignored it until one day she literally throw me the phone number for a psychologist after we argued about something unrelated to this, telling me ""Go cure yourself, so maybe you become more normal and reasonable"". She's so insensitive for someone that had my same problem, and I learned the biggest lesson of my life: the solution is just me. I'm working on my problems alone, and it's better this way.

J e s u s. Did you know that Jesus was abused? Yes our Creator God was abused on the cross and people who are abused have every right and every reason to draw near to him he is the most excellent father and trust me when I tell you those who have hurt you and have not repented or shown remorse don't worry about getting revenge because revenge is in the hands of God whether you want it or not those people will get into big trouble with him and you will get Avenged for what was done and what was not done as a child. Peace be with you all and God bless you in Jesus of Nazareth name from One 47 year old woman who was drug through a clothesline of abuse in every which way possible not going to get in here to comparing notes just sharing what helps me and staying in the fact that there's power in words put into action don't get stuck on your diagnonsense.

Thank you Holy Father I wait the day I wrapped in your arms in my robe of righteousness. Peace be with you all NPS no I'm not a preacher I'm not even a teacher but I would hope if you had something cool to share that happened to you whether it was with Buddha or Allah or Shiva or Ganesh or whatever you believe in that you would share it. Some will judge me as a Bible Basher or Jesus Freak and I'm okay with that cuz I'm confident as I've consecrated Matthew 16 24to26 my hands are out of this world it is finished like the Lord said right before he took his last breath and died upon the cross. So go ahead tell me there is no God and I will call you a fool. Just because you think God is the reason for all the cruelty in the world but that's untrue if you believe that you're being deceived. There is evil in this world and God will deal with it in his timing. Your job is to trust him and give him your heart the way he gave everything to you.

Understanding within ourselves does not erase the past traumas nor will it provide comfort as the more we speak about the traumas the more we dominate it? I dont know but I have researched enough into my own past and I believe those who are ADHD can help identify others ....My whole life flashed before my eyes as I got deeper into my self analysis about my own experiences only to actually discover the reason I was never tested was a stigma, fear or lack thereof, of reply or response to the distinction. The doctors told my moms, oh do not worry he is normal. Fear of the distinct label society would place upon myself and my parents and trusting an opinion over fact! To me, if you really want to help, find others who are ADHD who can openly talk about past traumas and understand it is not a disorder but evolution in some ways.

These abusive/neglectful homes are really preparing the child for subordination to a system of abuse. Must I lists the many obvious facts? Pedophilia rampant in public institutions of power; government,schools and churches. The abuse  regression of workers rights,consumer protections, protection of clean chemical free water,air and food products. The abuse of medical care and or access to real care not bribed by for profit hmo's and pharma. The collective abuse of ignoring the most victimized and blaming them as well as ignoring  them and leaving them homeless to increase the speedient end of their lives. This microcosm of abuse/neglect in the family unit is just that of the macro which is in part what increases and reinforces more of the same in those family units.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I was abused my entire childhood by an explosive, violent, narcissistic, charismatic, father and older sister. I followed all of the advice I heard throughout my childhood, ""If you feel depressed, tell someone. If someone hurts you, tell someone."" I spent much of my life, from 9 years old till 19 years old telling people. I got put on 15 pills a day. I was over 300 pounds by Junior High because of the medications. Antidepressants, antipsychotics, on top of anti-anxiety, on top of heartburn medication, on top of asthma medication, on top of insulin resistance medication, etc. I was so medicated, I couldn't finish my own sentences. School counselors, neighbors, peers, friends, professional mental health workers, everyone knew my father was abusive. Nobody ever did anything for me throughout my entire life. No one ever came to save me. I am now approaching my 30s, have been disabled my entire life because of complex post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, constant severe suicidal ideation, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and avoidant personality disorder. I will likely kill myself before I'm 30. I never expected to last this long.

So, now that we can confidently say that 'Abuse is not just bad, it's REALLY bad', can we as a society finally start doing something about this?! Will you stop ignoring the people you know in your own life that are being abused? Can we find better ways than calling Child Protective Services? And if not, can we at least call the help available for today's youth that nobody did for me? Don't let kids suffer like I did.

But what’s worse is the risky lifestyle I lead growing up as a teen, through my 20’s and 30’s. You walk around the city you grew up and live in with people now judging you and speaking about you negatively, everywhere you go. Because of bad decisions you have made.
 Just now finding out why everything I’ve been doing, the physical/emotional toll it has taken on me, is mostly attributed to the emotional/physical abuse, I experienced from my father. It was so bad it forced me to flee from my home at 16 to live with a foster family. Ever since that time I have been making poor decisions too many times to remember , and have had behavioral issues my whole life. But the worst part about all of it is that I blamed myself for everything for years. Thinking there was something wrong with me, and that I deserve all the bad karma that has come my way. But in fact the childhood I had to endure set me up for most of these trouble’s later on.

But I know my siblings are affected but me not so much. My sister is definitely depressed. Even though we went through the same things I feel like people handle trauma differently too. As well as their mindsets.

Me and my sister although are often on the same wavelength, actually have different emotions towards what had happened. 

When we went to the psychologists when we were kids they said nothing was wrong with us lol. I think it's because we were quite opens about what happened. Didn't avoid it. Pretty happy well at least smiling.

But I do get sicker easier than my sister. My brother gets an asthma attack like every morning.  Well at least once a week. Until we moved houses. And my sister and mother definitely both siffer from depression or anxiety.

I also feel like there is something wrong with my heart as at least once a month my heartbeat would become irregular for a couple of seconds. I went to the doctor who asked, ""Does your family have a history of heart disease?"" Which we said no. They took my blood pressure which was normal and said it was nothing. Or tgat it happened when stressed.

But I personally find it very annoying. It happens even when I'm not stressed. I tried telling the doctor that but he didn't agree. I said I have a holiday Now , no homework or uni. What is there to be stressed about? Still won't do anything. I asked for further testing he said we can monitor your heartbeat for a day. Lol.

It happens once a month not everyday. It won't help and since it's something small I left it alone. For now it's fine but what if it becomes more regular? Oh well.

Absurers  for the win!!! 😂 if I die one day cause of my heart then that just proved j was right to be concerned. Otherwise I guess the doctor is probably right and tgat it's nothing. 🤘","Mental Health - Trauma, Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Depression, Mental Health - Anxiety"

Some people will bully you whove been through trauma growing up. Not everyone can be helped.

It isnt easy. Stay determined. Dont take no for an answer.  Dont stoop to others. 

Work out in your room. Do push ups and excercises before bed. If your dad comes in your room at night to molest you he'll see your busy doing your sets.

Producing children because the more you have the more you get .. have 2 kids of different sexes and you get a house almost free here because you need 3 bedrooms, that's the mentality, so they keep on making them and the kids from the previous baby daddies are even more neglected. Families on welfare have to get the same $$$ as working families so where is the incentive... the CAS is a joke because their mandate is to keep the kids in these families with the biological families unless the kids are bloodied with broken bones.

I'd tighten up, heart race, and wait to see what kind of night it would be. One of my childhood friends came over last week, and brought up how much the dented towel rack in the guest bathroom would bother her every time she'd dry her hands. Those dents were from my head. My mother beat me into the bathroom and I backed into the tub and fell in. She was bracing herself with the rack as she kicked me. She was infuriated that the medal rack fell off from her weight and used it to continue to beat me. Then, fastened it back into the wall, where it remained for years. As a mother myself, I can't understand how she could do so much damage to my spirit, body and heart. I'll never have the opportunity to confront her, as she committed suicide when I was 19.  I wish abusive parents could see past their anger, rage, depression, addiction, mental illness or whatever brought them to the dark place to become said abuser, and get help. If abusive parents got help, there would be so many more people feeling whole, happy and worthy as adults. All I can say, is if you were abused, I'm sorry and you're worth so much more. While the abuse doesn't have to define you, I also understand that it makes things harder in life, and ESPECIALLY interpersonal relationships.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"My Father was consistently verbally abusive to my Mother which I absolutely hated. All I can remember from my childhood was blazing rights and rows between my Mum and Dad. He was also verbally abusive toward me and favoured my Sister beyond belief, and my Sister bullied me constantly as a child. Unfortunately back then I wasn't diagnosed with anything but I struggled so badly with attention in school and to make matters worse I had loads of nervous ticks. Essentially my own self view was so unbelievably low and I never believed I could achieve anything. This was only validated by my Father who stopped paying for my education due to me struggling with grades. I am now 40 years of age and am currently going through a depression. I was diagnosed last years with PTSD and seriously need to go talk to someone. I also drink way too much and I'm a smoker. Life just seems so pointless however I would not class myself as suicidal despite thoughts lingering. I really thought that I had sorted out this aspect of my life, but I really haven't. It seems so abundantly clear to me how much my early childhood has affected me and it breaks my heart.

Shortly after I arrived back home, my mother tried to kill my father with a butcher knife. I spent a year living with a girlfriend and her grandmother for grade 7, when my mother was again hospitalized. I was so terrified all the time, that school teachers thought I was retarded. I almost NEVER spoke in class or anywhere else. We never had company over, and we never went out anywhere.  Somehow I managed to get a job at age 16 and worked full time. I met a wonderful man when I was 27 and John was only 20. We were married. Just 8 years later he was burned in a car wreck. John was rear-ended by a drunk driver and died from 3rd degree burns to his body. I haven't worked since and that was almost 30 years ago. I suffer from chronic high levels of anxiety and depression.

but the world wasn't working right, and so it spiraled down
what was happening? I stopped, sat, and let it be
the world was just fine - this Chaos was in me

I sought to help others, but it was me who suffered more
from another who came and left Chaos at my door
They too tried their best, to foster my way through
But at that time, I was fine, the world created me anew

In the world I saw fury roar but now I stayed quite still
All the people needed then, was a space for Chaos to fill
Until it unwound and became clear again, I'd listen as it rose
And slowly music formed itself - nature's sound composed

Years passed before a friend requested my humble advice
she'd been confused at my acceptance, our world was in strife
we'd grown apart over new changes so I decided to say goodbye
so I said it clear, here's my acceptance and this is the reason why:

""I love myself, so myself I keep. I love you too, so I set you free.""

And with that the day settled, and the world was within me.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"when i was really young, 8 or 9. i didn't like doing homework and my parents were never home during the day to enforce it. when they came home they would almost always physically hit me. sometimes keeping me up at night to do math or something. One particular moment i remember is when i was asked to solve a double digit addition problem and i had brain fart and could't solve it. I was hit with the blunt force of a full sized arm and yelled at, telling me i was worthless, followed by a train of cussing. This would occur almost 3-4 times a week.

I had an older brother who at the time would leave me in isolation, hogging any tv or game console. he had an anger issue most likely also due to corporal punishment. at least 1 day out of the week he would vent out punches to me.

At night, i would have nightmares. nothing but a slurry of rainbow colors and the terrifying sound of my father's yelling. Whenever i had this dream i would always wet my bed. My parents would hit me in the morning because of this. Around this time at age 12 i would think about suicide constantly. This would happen every night until i was 14. Not surprisingly, after my parents gave up on ""correcting"" my behavior, the hitting stopped, and shortly after, the nightmares and bed wetting stopped.

I'm the only one in the family who has succumbed to drinking, smoking cigarettes, smoking pot, risky sexual activity, illegal activities, and psychedelics. I'm 25 this year and to this day i'm still battling depression because of it. People say i smile alot and am cheerful, but i know deep inside its just a facade.

I wish i could say my relationship with my family were better, but there is a barrier. I hardly know them. I know it is in the past, but sometimes i can't help but to feel sadness and fury because i know my life would've turned out way differently if the physical and emotional abuse were out of the equation.

I agree with her talking about the reward center, however this often doesn't get corrected, not because of a lack of education but because the person is too busy figuring out how to get by and may never get the clues needed to make a successful readjustment. I too had what could be described as a tough childhood and long suffered on the self control scale. I hate to keep plugging my 420 Electronic Monitoring lock, but it has changed me, so much so that in the past I could not buy a bar of chocolate and not eat it all within one day. Likewise for pot. Having the simple technological assistance from the lock has changed all that.

I thought after using the lock when my current stash ran out I would use it for other things like chocolate and wine. Now in my 70th year I'm no longer a regular alcohol drinker, so it didn't phase me much and I've only been sipping a small glass of Cabernet Sauvignon with my meal in the last week. Then it happened. I started to get a sharp tooth pain and immediately googled wine and tooth enamel. Sure enough wine was the culprit. Google said the cure was cheese, which probably gave rise to the folklore of my wine and cheese parties. Looking back I probably destroyed my teeth when I would drink a bottle of wine every night in restaurants without ever knowing why my personal habits were harming me. My point is that self-knowledge and technology can change the wiring of a brain almost over night.

Yesterday I bought two bars of chocolate and these will go into my lock box when its 4 day cycle opens in two days. Knowing I had the safety of the lock to fall back on I haven't even bothered to open the chocolate. I give this Youtube 5/10 for being right about the symptoms but no more because it lacks the insight of how modern individuals gain knowledge.",other

It's what led to the development of my dissertation on the Psychology of Good Bosses vs. Bad Bosses and what can be done about it.  Those bad bosses we have all dealt with in life at work have their foundation in early childhood upbringing.  We've done so much about physical safety in the workplace but little has been done about psychological safety which is the foundation of what Dr. Burke is talking about.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I know this is why I’m so sick. I am completely convinced that the severe way my and my sister’s body manifested a genetic disorder compared to the much milder way it has either affected or skipped our 8 siblings is because we were the youngest of 10 children and my mother was in the throes of menopause, and before, during and after, she was depressed and suffered with a personality syndrome. We were treated the worst. We were treated the way children should never be treated and were threatened daily that she would run away in the night because we were “bad girls”. We lived in constant fear and my father, who was as close to a saint as a man can be, was also at her mercy and left with no way of really protecting us when his job took him away from jome for weeks at a time and he would be greeted not with a hug and a kiss from mom but with a list of all the things we had to be punished for even if it happened the day after he left and it was 3 weeks old when he returned. I fear for my children for the few things they saw as children. With my illness and the severe pain it caused, I had little patience for my husband, and because he had to do so many of the things I was no longer able to do, he was tired and had little patience for me. We fought often and the kids saw it a few times  when it got really bad and that one time when I called the police because he held me down and hurt and bruised my body under his weight. They sobbed when they saw their dad being taken away and I’m so worried they are hurt for life. My husband and I got counselling and he got more on his own. We talked and talked and we understood how we both came from very hurtful childhoods. He is supportive and takes great care of me and the children and I continue to do what I can but my illness is degenerative and every year I can do less and less. But we know we love each other and the grudge is gone. The kids see us hugging and giving each other a quick kiss and they always say “eww guys”. Lol. Whatever happened between my husband and I, the kids knew they were loved and we told them all the time. They tell us that they love us and that they have the best parents in the world, but is what we’ve changed going to be enough to keep them mentally and physically healthy. I worry about this all the time and this video has caused me to worry even more. I know I suffered from my experiences as a child, I would die if I knew the difficult things they experienced has permanently harmed them. As parents, we are responsible for keeping our children healthy and happy. If you are having problems with your spouse or partner, please get some kind of help immediately. A fight is not worth worrying about the future mental or physical well-being of your children because of their negative experiences. A couple can work through their problems to fall completely in love again and fully respect each other, we did it, but please don’t wait for your children to hear or see things. Knowing they have these experiences as memories is devastating. If you have your own experiences from your childhood, you should know that you would do anything to keep them away from that torture. We should have known better but egos are awful things. We know better now and just hope and pray that we can make more wonderful ones that will outshine the bad ones.",Mental Health - Fear
95ovIJ3dsNk,"I live in an area that lost funding for behavioral health services and especially pediatric behavioral health services. There are many children that are not able to receive mental health services. Unfortunately, this lack of services has increased severe symptoms of mental health. Now, due to these symptoms, this ACE theory is being pushed in our schools and with social workers. These systems are using this as a way of blaming the families rather than the genetic components that correlate with mental health and how the lack of services have significantly increased the symptoms and negative outcomes of children. The systems are now blaming parents, loving parents. All children with mental health diagnoses are a result of their parents. Parents that are providing for their children, loving them, dedicating their lives for providing the best for the children. These parents are being attacked. How can we stop this? How can we protect parents? From what I have watched of the ACE trauma, it appears to be speaking of extreme stressors and abuse. So now, all parents are abusive and this system is tearing good families apart rather than taking responsibility for freezing behavior health services. I understand that there are children who have been through trauma, many. But this is being used as a way of blame and of attacking good families. How do we protect families from corrupt systems that are using ACE as a way to push the blame off of themselves? As families are torn apart, how will this ultimately affect our society? I know many families that have moved away to obtain services for the children, and I am now seeing that that is the only choice. Please, social workers, do not jump to ACE as the one size fits all and assume that all mental health issues are from a child's parents/home environment. Let's not tear apart good families who are loving trying to help their children.","Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Trauma"

I loved this ted talk, definitely, but I can't let go of the fact that she called America's response to HIV/AIDS a ""success"" and ""part of a good track record for responding to public health crisises"". The American government actively banned health officials and doctors and researchers from discussing/researching AIDS, they actively left thousands and thousands of people to die and refused to acknowledge them, they used the fact that AIDS primarily affected gay men and trans women to demonize them and wipe out large portions of their communities. It took years and years for the crisis to even be ACKNOWLEDGED. And when it was, it was framed as ""divine punishment"" for gay people more often than not.

The medical schools follow JD Rockefeller’s format of treating symptoms with chemicals which is called medicine but They know the side effects could kill you.  Side Effects are your body’s cry for help from toxicity.. It’s literally rejecting the medication/chemicals...Mr Rockefeller needed a way to introduce these chemicals  into the population what better way than to tell us it’s medicine.  It was made in a laboratory for the objective of Making Money and he is hand over fist..
No one but Holistic doctors provide care from the position that you aspire to take and that’s FIND THE ROOT CAUSE ADDRESS IT NATURALLY OPPOSE TO JUST TREATING SYMPTOMS.. SYMPTOMS MANIFEST TO LET YOU KNOW THERE IS A BIGGER PROBLEM SO FIND IT AND FIX IT... NOT ROCKET SCIENCE.... iF I cover up the symptom,  say it’s pain and the problem is appendicitis...IF THAT INFLAMMATORY PAIN isn’t addressed then the APPENDIX WILL RUPTURE THEN YOU HAVE A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION 
THIS IS THE SAME WITH EVERY DISEASE PROCESS ... IF HEALING IS YOUR GOAL ...
YOU FIND ROOT CAUSE AND FIX THE PROBLEM, NOT TREAT THE SYMPTOMS, WHOSE ONLY JOB IS TO LET YOU KNOW 
HEY YOU GOT A PROBLEM IN HERE.. SYMPTOMS ARE MESSENGERS 

THE ONLY REASON THE MODALITY CHANGED FROM THE POSITION OF WRITING DOWN A LIST OF SYMPTOMS AND RUNNING TESTS TO RULE OUT CERTAIN DISEASES UNTIL WE FIND A CAUSE, IS BECAUSE,  MR ROCKEFELLER PUT HIS PEOPLE ON THE BOARD OF THESE UNIVERSITIES AND GAVE THEM HUGE SUMS OF MONEY TO CHANGE THEIR MODALITIES, Their approach and train the medical students /future doctors to JUST TREAT SYMPTOMS.
The curriculum changed for a price who cares that PEOPLE DIE the very thing you dedicate your life to prevent
Never mind the link between proper diet and health ....Doctors get virtually no nutrition in their curriculum 
YOU UNDERSTAND DON’T PUT UNLEADED GAS IN YOUR CAR IF IT’S SUPPOSED TO HAVE PREMIUM, Don’t put oil in the gas tank, getting oil changes is the life of the car, tune ups necessary, a timing belt change after X NUMBER OF MILES
WE UNDERSTAND THIS, SO WHY DON’T WE GET THAT WE CANT JUST PUT ANYTHING IN OUR MOUTH AND EXPECT IT TO BE OK
LIKE OUR CAR OUR BODIES NEED CERTAIN MINERALS TO MAINTAIN HEALTH

MR ROCKEFELLER HAD A CLEVER AGENDA MAKE CHEAP CHEMICALS USE OUR UNIVERSITIES TO PRODUCE DOCTORS WHO PUSH THE CHEMICALS AS MEDICINE 
REAL MEDICINE CURES ...CHEMICALS MASK THE REAL PROBLEM AND TREAT THE SYMPTOMS (Messengers) And Cause a TON OF SIDE EFFECTS THAT MAKE YOU WORSE 
AND THEY MAKE A TON OF MONEY TO MANAGE YOUR SYMPTOMS To name a few:
High Blood Pressure 
Diabetes 
COPD 
NOW HIV
Lupus
Heart disease 
MS
And the list goes on you buy your pills every month, without fail because you want to live, while your doctor knows long term the side effects will kill you...WHILE MR ROCKEFELLER LAUGHS ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK
MANY OF THESE DRUG SALES ARE LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR.... So your modality mam is correct and Awesome but the MEDICAL INDUSTRY DOES’NT CARE ..IT CARES ABOUT THE BENJAMINS
THEY GO IN THEIR LABS AND IT COST THEM 50 cents to make your pill and they charge poor senior citizens $150.00  to get It and We  think it’s helping because we get a break from our symptoms “OH SIR YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE PILLS ARE REALLY MANAGING YOU WELL 130/84 “ BUT THE SIDE EFFECT IS 
IMPOTENCE... WHO IS REALLY LOOKING FOR A CURE IF DOCTORS ARE ONLY TRAINED TO TREAT SYMPTOMS... WHICH IS  FAR MORE LUCRATIVE ...

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Dear Nadine, You are a wonderful person and I thank God for people like you. I could see the love and dedication you have to help these children avoid a horrible future. I am 56 and yes, I am Caucasian. Many people are so ignorant because they believe that child abuse and domestic abuse only happens in minority families or in the ""ghetto."" To me, these people are hateful and prejudiced. I grew up in a home and was raised by two narcissists and I'm positive that you know what that means. I tried so hard to be a good girl and didn't understand why I was treated so horribly by my parents, who everyone else in the world just loved. I thought they were horrid so I believed that I was bad. My father began molesting me at 4 and my mother, a registered nurse knew it. Who did she blame? Me. She said she wished I was never born, that I had never been wanted and that I ruined her marriage and she kept telling me these things over and over year after year. When I was 20 and my younger brother died, she told me, yes, I did have a favorite and it was your brother, not you. She told me that if it had been me who had died that it would have been much easier on her and that she would be able to deal with it much better. I could go on and on but you get the picture. My father ran hot and cold. I never knew who he was going to be. And yes, he was a domestic abuser. As a young child he never laid a hand on me but he beat my 3 year old baby brother, leaving marks on his baby skin. I was 5 and my heart bled for him. At 14, I had a party when my parents weren't home and guilty as charged, there was alcohol. My father came home 3 hours earlier than usual from his poker game and was in a rage. He sent me and my friend and my brother up to bed and told us to be ready for a meeting the next day. He terrified my friend the next am. Finally I said, enough and my brother made some remark. My father got up to go after my 12 year old brother but I shoved my brother toward the stairs to get away so my father told me I'd get the punishment instead. He punched me in the jaw and knocked me out. He broke my jaw that day and I never told my mother. Why would I? Anyway, I was always very sick as a child  and I was told that I was faking it. I married an abuser. Then,  when I was about 34 I was bitten by a Lyme tick (actually 3 times). My immune system was so damaged by all of the trauma that I am now so sick that I'm almost completely bedridden. The good news is that I divorced the first abuser who I married (for I cannot call him a husband, he doesn't deserve the title) and I'm remarried to the most wonderful man in the world. I am slowly making my way back to becoming better and these Utube videos are helping me. I just began liking myself this past February. Before that I hated myself my entire life. Now I know that I'm a good, kind, compassionate woman who never hurt anyone. It was the other way around. I know this is very lengthy.. Please forgive me, the Lyme disease caused permanent CNS damage and Ialso have about 8 co-infections along with the Lyme. God Bless you always Dr. Nadine! I wish there were more people out there like you in this world. You are a blessing from God. I'm on disability and can't afford a lot but if there was some way to let me know how to donate, I would donate $25 to your cause. Most gratefully always, Donna",Mental Health - Trauma

I am glad this doctor realized that ! We need more like her and fewer like those who try to treat depressed people with mind-altering drugs because they strictly follow the medical-biological model and do not take trauma into account because that is an easy way to absolve themselves and others from the GUILT that comes after parents and caregivers realize how badly they have messed their children's lives up.

From 06:55 - Harris starts to describe that people who score high on the ACE scale of childhood adversities are more likely to exhibit behaviours that can best be described as personality disordered. Put simply, narcissists are very likely to put their children through childhood adversities and those children will then score high on the ACE's and will be far more likely to develop personality disorders themselves because they have inherited the disorder from their parents. The Hunter Gene, for example.

Brain scans of serial killers have shown that psychopaths have abnormal brains that gain pleasure from inflicting pain on others and who also show little or no fear responses. One-third of serial killers report that they were not abused as children in any way and yet their brains show this abnormality.

Then there are also those children who have narcissist parents but have not inherited their parents narcissistic genes. They are the ones who truly suffer, as they actually possess a conscience and, therefore, the emotional capacity for suffering.",Mental Health - Fear

95ovIJ3dsNk,"I don't even understand why anyone would give this video a thumbs down. This woman was practically explaining my childhood story. My father was killed when I was 7yrs old (gun shot to the head-Trauma 1) and my mother (who I believe has Borderline Personality Disorder-Trauma 2), found a boyfriend months after my father died and he was an alcoholic. He used to beat (Trauma 3) my mother almost daily—for 8yrs! Do you know what that does to a child? I lived that nightmare life until I was in high school. Not only that, but my mother in turn would beat (Trauma 4) me and my sister if we spilled a glass of juice or if God forbid if we didn't keep good grades in school despite living in that environment (how can any child concentrate?—I struggled for years). 

I suffer from anxiety and sometimes panic attacks. I also have fear of many things as a result of that traumatizing childhood that I lived through. Living with that has also made me an angry person—especially towards my mother. I am finding healing through my faith in God and this has been working for me as of 2006. It doesn't go away over night. It is a process—a life long journey towards healing my mind, body and soul. If it took years to ""build up"" it will take years to ""break down"" and it starts by choosing to recognize that there is a problem and choosing to do something about it—and it is by no means easy. 

In my life today, I manage to marry a wonderful man and we have a beautiful daughter together. We are raising her with nothing but love. I have a good diet and exercise as much as I can. I also find that forgiveness is helping me to heal as well. The effects of my trauma are ""not gone"" but they are not as ""severe"". So yes, there is always hope to ""over come"" the negative damage that was left behind. It wont be ""erased"" but it will not be ""repeated"". That was a choice I made once my daughter was born.

I will recommend two books I have read (and am currently reading)—Joyce Meyer, ""Battlefield of the Mind"" (talks about how we can control our thoughts) and Dr. Caroline Leaf, ""Who Switched off my Brain?"" (talks about the science of how our thoughts send signals to the rest of the body that affects our physical health). They are both ""Christian inspired"" but very informative reads for anyone looking to ""find a beginning"". I found that having angry thoughts and replaying the trauma in my head kept me prisoner of that trauma for so many years. So changing my thoughts is SLOWLY proving to be very effective—but it takes ALLOT of practice.

If you are a parent suffering—please dont let your kids suffer like this. Get help. Seek faith in God and see if that helps or if you can get therapy then do that. Do ANYTHING you can to get the help you need because when there is a WILL there will ALWAYS be a way. There healing out there, but its up to you. God Bless.","Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Therapy, Mental Health - Trauma, Mental Health - Anxiety, Recovery & Self Care"

One year ago the tactical assault of intimate partner violence and parental alienation took the legal malfeasance route to stealvmy child by her dad whom i never married never functioned together as a family. he abducted her in 2014 and looking back on that day in court, and the 3 times since then i brought matters back, cooperating with him all the way, and being fair and considerate *( since my dad alienated me from my mom and i wasnt going to do that to my child.) i have all the evidence.  our lives before, the police records he falsely lodged trying to create a false record, the  communication attempts to coparent and he just ignored me, my daughrers escalating fears... the drawings.. the ugly part is that its possible he is involved in some kind of child exploitation cult, but set that aside since the court disregarded everything and just forced me into this terrorizing violent premeditated manslaughter it feels like. he hangs up the phone..didnt even let us talk for the first six months.. the cops and cps are directly ignoring this.,  Who can i call? I know the legal standing arguments and am preparing the next wave of filings but, he wont tell me where swhe goes to school or talk to her therapist.. she and i are holding on strong.she is turning 9, but i can tell he abuses her somehow..somehow punishes her when i say i love her and I am working on getting her home, to teach her subtley not to want to talk to me or to create anxiety. I dont say those things always but every so often i make sure to say it before he can hang the phone up because i am not going to sit here and let him do this to us, to her about me,..she needs to know i will never give up. I am hanging on by a thread.. My case is a perfect example of people in the medical and behavioral fields  to get involved and use us as a poster campaign.... any suggestions?","Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Anxiety"

95ovIJ3dsNk,"It’s way deeper than this. If you can, for those who are interested please read this journal by AARM on addiction and childhood trauma. Lack of parental affection coupled with the repeated exposure to toxic stress actually damages the brain’s opioid and dopamine receptors, and overall ability to produce certain “good” hormones overall, that are related to stress, motivation, and sense of tranquility. People who are exposed to ACES actually produce less feel good hormones overall and their brains do not react to dopamine and opioids very efficiently, which leads to them being  unable to feel pleasure in everyday life without the additional substance to make up for what their brain lacks. This is so often why addicts come from abusive homes. They’re overcompensating for brain maldevelopment. 

The impact of early childhood development is so so so important. It’s why when you’re this hyper aware of all the nuance and in between it can be so challenging to be in the company of people who think nothing about teasing, yelling or spanking their kids. Letting their newborns cry themselves to sleep, or who restrict affection from fear they’ll soften their sons.","Mental Health - Fear, Physical & Mental Wellness, Mental Health - Addiction, Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Trauma, Personal Growth & Mindset"

The Principal Investigators were Joseph Felitti at UCSD and Robert Anda at the CDC. I collaboration with Kaiser, they conducted the study and have published dozens of papers on their results, which are of profound importance. Burke Harris seems to have co-opted and exploited that work. She's doing great work at her Center, to be sure. And I think it is great that she has been instrumental in publicizing the results. But I think insufficient acknowledgement is given to those who pioneered this work, and continue to labor in this ongoing study. Generally she just gives passing reference to the study, and tacitly implies that they didn't really realize the significance of their results, and it was she who did, and really applied the results.

So how to prevent ACEs?  Does logic dictate that the parent who at best isnt very bright or informed and at worst is responsible for most of the ACE's would allow or seek out things like evaluations of the child or whatever?  even if it was some how a mandatory part of kindergarten or whatever i know if a teacher said ""by the way miss your daughter has experienced a significant amount of unnecessary stress/trauma and we should do something about it"" my mother would be so personally enraged that i am sure she would move me to another school, and make sure i damn well knew what was in my best interest to keep the bad to myself and even fake smile or whatever.  so how do these kids get noticed early enough to prevent these ACEs?  and if the group ""school, doctor, government"" is not ready to remove the child/children from the home then what?  i'm 100% sure that my mother would have actively got in the way of this process.  i think its a nice thought and sorta like ""wouldnt it be wonderful if we could prevent these things while we rode our unicorns to moon"".  i just cant think of a viable way to do so without risking that the result of the evaluation might cause the poor kid to have way more ACE's than they would have otherwise.   thats just my 2 cents","Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Trauma"

I am studying clinical psychology at Eötvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary. At the moment I am collecting information for my master thesis under the direction of Prof. Attila Szabo. This is about people who have been a subject of sexual harassment or abuse in sports when they were a child. This is a topic, which is relevantly new in terms of research and there is a need to get in-depth knowledge from those who have experienced it. This is important so that preventive guidelines can be developed and supplemented, and future incidences may be prevented. We know that harassment and abuse in sports often goes unreported, so it is hard to get in contact with people who have experienced this. I have an online survey, which is 100% anonymous that asks open-ended questions about the abuse that has occurred. 

If you have experienced this I would appreciate it if you could answer the survey. Since the survey is anonymous, I cannot offer any help, except advice to contact a professional if you feel you need it, for those who answer me, but I can assure you that your contribution is of importance so that further incidences may be prevented!

This is scary...",other
95ovIJ3dsNk,"While advocating for mental health issues seems to be at an all time high, the situations that caused these issues are not readily discussed. In fact, they are often a sort of taboo,  an issue that would not be appropriate to discuss in public or at the dinner table. However, it is important that we start talking about the situations that cause these mental health problems in order to put a stop to them. These are not situations that only occur into adulthood that drive mental health issues. But instead, adverse childhood experiences (aces) can result in mental health issues, as well as overall health issues. Those that had experienced trauma in their childhood were more likely to have cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, and to attempt to take their own life. Often times, because these experiences are so rarely discussed, many are not aware of the extreme rate that they take place and the effects that they may have later in life. Many place blame on those that may have experienced said situations that turn to a vice, such as drinking or drugs. They define it as ""bad behavior"" or simply have the mentality of just saying make good decisions and don't do it. However, this video makes a point that should be more widely noted, those that had aces, have had actual, measurable changes to their neurological structures that put them at risk for these dependent behaviors. After learning of this information it seems odd that more isn't being done to combat such trauma. It is important that this information be a part of training in order to help prevent the emotional, physical, and health damages that may result from one or many adverse childhood experiences.","Mental Health - Depression, Mental Health - Trauma"

If the teachers have no empathetic qualities or are not emotionally intelligent, they will be far more likely not to give a care about deep rooted preliminary issues that govern the behaviors learning and otherwise the children in classroom display today!

When a child has that type of response of response almost every day in an environment that they should feel safe in, it now seems so clear that this would change the way they develop and impact their health later in life. I found it very shocking that many of the people who had these diseases later in life did not participate in any high risk behaviors and they still developed the diseases anyways.

I'm 18 now but my brain is still developing. I'm struggling in school and I'm getting low grades, purely because of the emotional stress I have to go through. And not only that, I have some bad childhood memories too that comes up in my mind.
My father died in his early 30s. I was around 12 when that happened. It was because of a heart attack, and I never really got to know him that well. And that is what hurts the most; I didn't get to acknowledge my father, my closest family member after my mother.
The other thing that happened around the same year was, well... It's rather personal, but I think it's better to share it with the whole world, if it means that I can get some help one day when I need it the most.
Long story short; I almost got raped at the age of 12. Even though I'm not traumatised a lot about this, I never got to go to a psychologist or anything like that, but at the same time I really wish I got to at that early age.

The point here is that there are so many things that can affect a child's growth and development. There is so much trauma that can be caused by things that slip under the radar.

  I've always been thin, but i eat as a mouth / stomach 'fetish'.
  I think it must be stuffing my mouth from childhood so as to avoid my overwhelming desire to scream at my father, day after day, night after night. .   My siblings and i  walked on eggshells around him for years.    The dinner time table was so traumatic for me that i will never forget certain scenes.  I've always assumed that many people  have that same problem . 
   And it's not about food causing obesity,  luckily we were athletic  -  most in my family are not too heavy even still - 30 or more years later.
  It was just that we all sat around the table and most of us simply felt scared , uncomfortable that Dad would do something that would make us cringe,  or cry.     You cannot go thru childhood anticipating the next cringe, the next argument that was accompanied by total awkwardness and - i could go on forever.   i guess i should write a book .

Eventhough, I wasn't physically abusive, I always show them love and I was always there for them; (whereas my parents weren't there, ever for me), I didn't show my children that they are good enough, I wanted them to do better than they are, which makes  them feel guilty for disappointing me.

One of the best resources I've come across is Karla McLaren's book Language of Emotions, which is a fantastic accelerator when the only way out is through. Since body symptoms have emotional roots (body is a hologram of the mind), it makes sense that resolving those flight-or-fight moments - even decades later - may prevent a lot of symptomatic illness, and even reverse damage sustained from ACE exposure.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Not sure on the validity of this study.. The results seem great, however there seems to be a fundamental problem. The other risks were not taken into account. 
""An ACE score above 4 leads to a x2.5 higher RR of developing COPD"".. Sure, but the info I want to know is a correlation between ACE scores & other risk factors !

- Does an increased ACE score lead to higher risk of smoking? Drinking? (Hence the COPD & hepatitis RR increase?) : this would -make a high ACE score an INDIRECT RISK FACTOR.
- Or is it that if you are brought up in an environment where you are susceptible to be exposed to a higher ACE score, are you also more susceptible to have higher chances of smoking/drinking? : this would make a high ACE score an INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR, maybe even not a risk factor at all !

What I'm trying to say is that an elevated ACE score is not necessarily a direct risk factor when it comes to health outcomes like the conference seems to suggest.. It would take a much more complete study than this one to be able to truly establish this link. This is a typical media orientated study, that lacks true science.
HOWEVER I hugely agree with it, from an informing point of view. Studies like this sound great to the public ear, studies like this change the way people think about adverse childhood experiences so I'm all for it.
But, this isn't good, reliable science.

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Excellent.  
When online ""ADHA/Aspergers Tests"" became available, I of course took one.  The FIRST THING I noticed was that the ""symptoms"" listed bore a striking resemblance to how abused children act.  Not looking people in the eye, being completely tuned in to something (to tune out the chaos of the home environment), perfectionism, not having friends or social skills - all of these things I do.  But I know the source of these behaviors is not ""all in my head"", and I CAN do the things if I trust and feel safe.  I didn't because of the abuse in my home.
So before we willy nilly diagnose a child as being Aspergers or ADHD, we do need to be sure the child isn't acting this way because of abuse.
How do we gain the child's trust for them to tell?  And telling a parent to not abuse their child, not starve their child when they are working 3 jobs and barely making rent, not to ignore their child when they are at these 3 jobs is rather touchy.",other

95ovIJ3dsNk,"Finally a voice of sanity,  I have worked with kids too.  Many of us believe the majority of cops and doctors  blame these child victims for the crimes and trauma they go through - these professionals are often ""blame the victim"" experts.  I believe it is because many of them are more dysfunctional than the kids - more suicidal, drug-addicted, alcoholic, abusive, prone to crime and violence, Eugenicist, etc. etc.  They project their dysfunctions onto these precious children so they don't have to look at it their own guilty consciences. They appear to prefer to further traumatize a child with forced incarceration and forced psychiatric drugging in the delusion of ""protecting society"" when it really is these professionals that society needs protection from.  As horrible as this sounds, the abusive parents are the ""good guys"" in the children's lives more often than not.  Not only do the kids have to survive the abuse, but then they are thrown into institutions or foster homes and have to survive surrounded by Nurse Ratcheds (I am not speaking of teachers, most of them really ""get it"" but have less power) or opportunistic foster parents.
Fight or flight/hypervigilance is the only life or state of being these beloved kids have ever known.  They need Love not punishment.  But society, institutions and Big Pharma do not make any money from Love.
Ultimately the ""label"" (diagnosis) is the final assault - and it comes from the supposed ""helping professions"" - to set up the lifelong pattern for low self-esteem, lack of goals or the desire to pursue them, victim identity, stigmatization, easy mark for criminals and further victimization, and of course a plethora of health problems.

How has a normal physiological response our bodies are wired to do for survival of the species become a ""mental illness""?

In this context trauma  must be seen as that specific persons emotional, physiological and psychological response to life experience.

Many more are guided by plain prejudice and insist it is they who aught to define the terms. The patient or client will never live up to the expectations of people who want to make it about themselves. They'll be traumatised further or punished. They'll then be a threat and made guilty.

iTefkqYQz8g,"What really solidified 25 years of trauma was trying to come out about what happened to me and my siblings growing up to my found family of friends, and them denying me. I was able to get through being sexually and physically abused so badly that I needed surgery twice because I had my 'friends,' but then when a surgeon took my ability to lift myself up and hold myself upright on my right side, they abandoned me. That solidified all the trauma, it hit me like a truck, and it never left. To me, the world is an evil place, and every person is selfish, narcissistic, and greedy, but worst, honestly, is that I honestly believe that everyone is so evil deep down that, given the opportunity, they absolutely would try to kill me. So, I'm scared of people and defensive before I even meet them, even though I don't want to be, which just solidifies the learned helplessness that everything is out of my control. 

I used to think that I was needed by my found family, and that kept me from wanting to commit suicide. But, once I saw how little I meant to them, I stopped caring completely. I just let the trauma take me because I didn't have the willpower or the physical strength to fight anymore. I collapsed. Part of me didn't care what happened to me, yet part of me wanted to fight with everything I had to take back what was mine (my body). And now, 9 years later, my body has finally come out of the freeze state, and all I can do is scream as what happened floods my memory even more vividly with every muscle movement, and cry as the muscles that were paralyzed start feeling again, but it's a buzzing, or burning, or the sharp agony of atrophy bearing up against my own weight that I feel, not some great euphoria like I had hoped. And, on top of it, the trauma from what the surgeon did every time I do physical therapy, the trauma of being raped and assaulted and held down by multiple people that I trusted and some that I loved every time I try to hug my partner, the fear of being ostracized because people can see the trauma, but they don't understand it, so they've verbally attacked me over it *in public* even though I'm trying my hardest to 'rise above' all of the evil things that happened to me an attempt to create something good out of this, by documenting what happened and revealing it to the public... Only for the public to treat me like absolute garbage every single time they have the opportunity to, regardless of their sex, race, age, financial status... It ALL floods my mind at once. And I become so overwhelmed that I can't even find words to speak to the people sitting right next to me, who helped me by showing me mercies during the last 3 years in the first place...

I've learned that I need to be alone, far away from almost all people, until society comes together and agrees that healing from evil like this takes a hell of a lot of time, effort, and commitment to moving through pain, so we, as a society, don't need to add to that pain by attacking people just because we have the opportunity to. If we really want to heal as a society, we need to come together and give each other the compassion and space to heal. Otherwise, it's just going to be a revolving door of shared hate, angst, and agony. 

I'm sorry for the long ramble, but my brain has started feeling articulate again. Thank you for giving me the space to share.","Mental Health - Therapy, Recovery & Self Care, Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Trauma"

The agency took advantage of my parents and influenced them to have me undergo a surgery to have my genitals removed without prior counsel or discussion. It was have me confused and traumatized. GOVERNMENT INTELLIGENCE SCRUTINIZED BOTH MY MOTHER AND I DUE TO RACE, STATUS AND INTERNAL BIASES.

The agency would support and plan a marital affair for my father by locating a younger mistress for my father when we returned to the States in 1987. The agency would then provide tasks to my mother while providing my father time to cheat with the mistress Government Intelligence carefully selected for him.

iTefkqYQz8g,"it is said that those who have an education have lower abuse, although not always true, it is easier to understand what is happening, know why something shouldn't be done and correct it. What has been found is behaviors inherited inaccurately that can take decades to identify and alter; these behaviors can take generations to correct if left unhindered.

if we take a look back towards the beginning of humanity, what we see is violence passed down socially and hereditary from barbaric war-like practices.

How we feel about ourselves, the opposites, and those around us can impact how we treat others. 

It is within human nature to want a living creature's love or loyalty, hence why some would cage or control, then find that the relationship lacking. What we wanted from the living being becomes a reflection of ourselves through the actions forced upon them. 

One of the stories that expressed well is a minor story within the 'Harry Potter' series about the history of the love potion. One young lady who was interbred desired a handsome man and chose to slip him a love potion. She knew full well that the effects were enforced thus he would never love her. After many years of being together she had wondered if the man truly loved her, for she truly loved him. Thus when it comes to love, set them free and free yourself.

The amount of pent up pain, years and years of sometimes debilitating pain, MRIs, CAT scans, x-rays, chiropractors, day missed of work, days missed of life.

Opening up new perspectives (for some time now) against the mainstream psychiatric categorizations  leading to dangerous misdiagnoses and wild drug prescription is absolutely necessary.

iTefkqYQz8g,"I had a poorly done surgery going from my chest to my navel at 10 days old, without anesthesia or rehabilitation. My body froze in that position, trying to protect the wound. As i grew up and had to walk, talk and all the other stuff, the adhesions never released the tension, so everything had to be done by pulling against the wound making it even more tight and just adding more tension in the body. 

Then in elementary school i had another surgery that pretty much froze the righr side of my body. I knew from the start that something was very wrong with me and was always in pain throughout my childhood, yet no one offered any help. People would comment sometimes, my movement lacked coordination, i had very bad anxiety and a myriad other physical and emotional issues.

Now the interesting part came around the age of 30. I had never up to that point connected the surgeries with my many issues. However, it had gotten so bad that i could hardly breathe and almost lost my voice entirely because of the ever increasing tension.

I saw an orthopedic surgeon but didn’t tell him of the abuse around the joint. He broke my pelvis in half, he didnt’ repair the pubic bones. One sits upon another. It took five years to get the diagnosis.

Six years of therapy. The who, why, what, when…etc. So how do i stop feeling like my skin is being electrocuted? I realized all those men took away my everything. They all reduced me to a powerless villain. Repressed rage is a violent emotion. I realized i had to find a way to feel empowered. Due to broken pelvis, i was limited. I took up back yard archery. A longbow with arrows. The bow was thirty five pounds, difficult to pull back, but i had rage within me to use. Every arrow that left my bow, took rage and pain with it. I shot arrows until my fingers bled, my forearm was bruised and bleeding. 

It was absolutely healing because i felt power return to me. I took thee violence of rage and used arrows to free it.

Drain repressed rage, pain, fear, terror…refill with pride in how powerful you can feel. I have to repeat as the trauma comes back but it’s akin to a top off.

Trauma is the reaction to an event that literally threatens your existence and the body gets locked into that stress response and can’t find a way out again. This means that the body remains chronically in fight, flight, or freeze mode, and this is no joke for the affected person and her environment. 

Another issue is CPTSD which results from a prolonged series of lesser traumatic events during childhood, often the result of chronic childhood abuse and neglect. People with CPTSD have a generally heightened alert system, and have difficulties handling everyday stressors. They will have very strong trauma reactions to events that are stressful but not life threatening, not because of the event itself, but because the event triggers an already over reactive and heightened alert system into overkill mode. Again, for the affected person and their environment, this is no joke and very burdensome. 

As someone diagnosed with CPTSD, it really annoys me when people claim to have been ‘traumatized’ by minor inconveniences, while they are laughing and joking about it. It is ridiculous and frankly pretty dumb to say things like this.","Mental Health - Stress, Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Trauma"

I still wonder what makes one human being more or less intentionally hurting another human, betraying them, robbing them, making them feel bad. What really starts to surface for me is how many of our traumatic experiences are forming an invisible force, a film, that covers our true SELF, our humanity, our potential. A layer that stops us from playing full out in daily life. We face challenges, thresholds to cross and we are not even aware why this is a challenge for us at this moment. Through my Transformational Coaching and the Pivotal Moment Technique I have the opportunity to have conversations with many people about those moments of choice. As we explore the situation where they have a choice to make, a challenge to face, we zoom into the scene and find the split second where the choice is actually to be made, we use the wisdom of the body. Physical sensations that show up, and we allow to be there instead of pushing them away or looking for a distraction. As we explore various traumatic experiences come to the surface. Experiences that were forgotten, or maybe were put behind a veil. Experiences big and small, From a remark that at the present moment would mean nothing to us that back then some how created a traumatic imprint.

Even people who pay to see fights don’t pay to see a heavy weight pounds down a feather weight. Yes there are some women who are abusive but they are less than 5% in a domestic violence relationship. Luckily there is footage to force them to the surface, but it’s more about coercive control in men, reinforced with violence. Important that you say this because it is the abuser and the abuse is the harm to children, not  the “fighting“. You are doing a phenomenal job describing the Vietnam war.

iTefkqYQz8g,"Started therapy at 20. Knew there was something “strange” about the way I would start violently shaking, lose the ability to speak, turn red, heart racing, etc., whenever someone yelled at me or someone else. Years of counseling helped some things, but never addressed what turned out to be repeated trauma responses to chronic abuse I suffered all throughout childhood. Then again, I rarely talked about it, nor do I recall being asked specifically. Even still, I just assumed all kids were being brutally beaten and berated behind closed doors. At 48, I still get nervous if someone stands behind me or if I hear voices that are too loud, sometimes even if they're cheerful voices. Cars that roar by with thumping base lines unconsciously remind me of the foot stomps I’d hear on their way to my childhood room as I’d tense up for another beating. This book connected all the dots for the first time and still does when I need to refer back to it. Therapies in my area are still lacking these days, but I just remind myself that just like someone with a pancreas that can’t make insulin, my nervous system struggles to stay calm in the face of triggers, but I keep at it.

iTefkqYQz8g,"It has been known since the dawn of man that telling your story over and over will diminsh its impact each time it is told. Trouble is, nobody wants to hear your story. Your story creates discomfort in the listener. people will avoid you so they dont have to hear it. That's why Mom is so important. Not every mom. A good spouse will listen but evetually becomes annoyed. Telling your story at an AA meeting or weight watchers takes the edge off trauma too. 
But moms are not arround forever and group dynamics have their own problems. That's why we hire shriks, to listen to our stories. We decide to believe that they dont judge. Problem with that is, if  they dont jjudge, how can there be empathy? A doctor who doesn't give a damn is just a business. They say that they must stay clinically distant to  see objectively. That's like saying that you can see better in black and white as opposed to living color.  So find yourself a sounding board who is ocncerned about you and tell your story. Even once, with brutal honesty, will dispell some trauma. In lieu of that, write. Dont chronicle, just scribble. No one else will see it but you . Just make it legible so that you can read it back to yourself, sometimes out loud. Then write it again. It'll be different the second time. Just a little, but you'll see your story from a slightly altered prospective, the one that changed when you saw your story on paper. Perception is everything. A spider in the bathroom is one thing to me, it's something completely different to my wife. Watching a human being explode beside you is a crippling experience to some. It's just fun for others.
You may not be able to tell your whole story. It can be far too painful to relive some of the horrors devised by humans. But even a little at a time can be cathardic. There are those who are just broken and would rather live with their misery than risk exposing themselves again. This, I think, is where a little chemical relief might be in order.",Mental Health - Trauma

iTefkqYQz8g,"It's difficult for me to convey how impactful Spravato (Ketamine Therapy) has been for ""resetting"" my traumatized brain.  I didn't realize how my default was set to 'overreact' to everything in life. It was as if I was walking around, and every situation was on a knife's edge, and if I perceived anything that might cause that balance to falter, I would immediately overreact in a highly emotional, irrational way.  This would show up over and over in everything from tiny interactions to large ones, and it had a significant impact on my relationships, both professionally and personally.  But with just a few sessions on Spravato, I felt my entire being finally ""relax"" in a way that I was able to walk around in life with a lightness, a freedom, in a way that I was actually able to CHOOSE how I wanted to respond to stimuli.  And the craziest thing?  It was almost effortless.  I didn't have to ""try super freaking hard"" to re-learn how to be a ""normal person"".  I simply went into the sessions with the intention of ""Help me, I'm ready to listen"" and my brain was able to do the rest.  The Spravato was able to allow my brain to ""break"" the old connections that had been formed during my traumatic events, and once it was free of that, it was able to start back fresh and new.  Literally it was like hitting the reset button on the Nintendo system.  I can't speak highly enough of this amazing treatment.  If anybody wants to know more, or thinks that any of my experience can be of help, please let me know.  I'd be thrilled to help somebody else in their journey, because I believe everybody deserves to feel whole like I am feeling now.","Mental Health - Therapy, Social & Emotional Wellbeing, Mental Health - Trauma"

In London, I was a full-time psychotherapist for 25-years. This psychiatrist has a point but having researched what our psyche is for over 57-years in total, there is a lot more going on in us than is being stated here. I have known people who have endured tremendous on-going trauma in childhood and come out on top when the experiences have been dealt with in therapy. I also have known those that have had no therapy and although there might be certain quirks remaining, they have become incredibly compassionate people.

Our body/mind/psyche has ways of dealing with situations and healing them to a degree where we can continue to function reasonably well. It's hard having a human experience. It's not healthy to make people feel they have hidden psychological problems. Being wounded is the NORMAL human condition - otherwise we are seeking to live in a fairy-tale perfect world which does not exist. 

We are here to grow and learn - especially in relation to the importance of love which basically means how to be kind.

iTefkqYQz8g,"Isn’t a normal family one that is abusive? If it’s all you know that’s your normal. I grew up in an abusive family and simply cannot cope with “normal”. Because my normal is always being in high alert, being fearful, being ready to jump to an order, flinching when someone moves quickly near me, being a people pleaser, being a doormat, being scared… I wish I was fucking dead. I’ve had enough",Mental Health - Fear

I get severe anxiety in some social situations like dates or conversations with your boss where there's actually no need to feel like that. Medidation has helped me alot with that too.

iTefkqYQz8g,"Never EVER beg for Love. 
True Love is given voluntarily, freely, openly, passionately! 
Everything else is toxic ABUSIVE bullshit!!!

Being your best self 
for the wrong person 
will bring out the worst version of you...

When you don’t know your value, 
people will put you in places you don’t deserve...

Anxious and avoidant styles are like the rabbit and the turtle story... 
Anxious people are furiously looking for solutions (usually on YouTube, and the like...) 
Like obsessed maniacs, 
while avoidants are in their turtle shells...
Letting their relationships collapse around them, 
too afraid to expose themselves...

Listen to the ""Game of Life and How to Play it"" 
by Florence Schovell Shinn ~ it will change your life!

- Come up with your desired reality: SEE it, FEEL it, EXPERIENCE it, BELIEVE it, KNOW it
- Persist in those affirmations and prayers and visualizations
- Do not react to your current reality (it's all IRRELEVANT!)
- Current circumstances do NOT matter

Before I met my husband, 
I manifested the kind of love I deserve...

I made a list with all the personality traits and physical characteristics of my future partner, 
and waited until he showed up in my life... 
He is real, and he is imperfectly perfect, like me. 

We fit just right, because it turns out he was waiting for me, too. 

We are grateful for each other, and together we manifest amazing things for our family. 

Anxiously attached partners only feel as safe as their last interaction with their partner...

Early signs of healing for anxious-attachers:

1. You recognize that you are responsible for the types of relationship you engage in...

2. You’re able to see limerence for what it really is!
(Believing the dreams and fantasies we have about someone 
over the reality we see about someone...)

3. You’re able to recognize the value of self-regulation 
and you’re creating strategies for reminding yourself that you’re okay! 
You can both co-regulate and self-regulate as needed/appropriate.

Our relationship with a person is the relationship we have with them NOW, today, 
not the relationship we hope to, fantasize to, wish to: have with them in the future!

If you're avoidant, 
you most likely have said to family members 
- who had a major role in your childhood: 
""You only accepted me or liked me 
when I was happy/obedient/emotionless."" 
This one simple statement fits with ALL 
the core symptoms 
of avoidant attachment: 

1. Being overly self-reliant 
(and in doing so, you hide your needs, emotions, problems, and acute illnesses)

2. Pushing down anger until it explodes 
and manufactures the boundaries you crave 
but can't/don't/won't always ask for

3. Not wanting to burden others with your problems

4. Wanting to fix your own issues to avoid looking incompetent 
or even getting bullied and teased/mocked

5. Numbing out emotions with self-soothing behaviors 
that are either totally unhealthy or pseudo-healthy 
(like getting addicted to working out and healthy eating)

Remember ALWAYS 
this process is all about YOU!!!
Not him. 

He is just a catalyst.

The most painful thing is losing yourself 
in the process of loving someone too much, 
and forgetting that YOU are special, too!

Consider, 
he may be your twin flame. 
Look into that. 

After he initiated your trauma, 
you're now left to deal with and to heal: 
all that has come to the surface.
GOOD! This is a blessing.
Albeit painful. A necessary blessing, nonetheless.
HUGE-HUGE gift! 

Major advice!!!

Listen closely!!!

NEVER ever 
CHASE HIM. 

He will run further 
and you will lose yourself more. 

You are the feminine. 
You are the divine goddess.

You just be 
and approve (or disapprove) 
whoever comes along. 

It's a yes: 
you meet my requirements, 
or: it's a no, 
you do not. 

Be clear 
on whom you're accepting as a partner 
and DO NOT settle for less 
(or you just delay what's actually really divinely meant for you). 

Accept your struggle, anxiety, fear, sadness. Whatever comes up. 
It's all human, and in need of your attention. 
If you push it away, deny it, block it, hide it, or run from it... 
You will just have to deal with it later...
And when later comes,
those emotions will be:
intensified/amplified/magnified!

1) Put yourself first and foremost!

2) Fall in love with yourself. Be your own dream girl. 

3) Rejection is redirection. 
Embrace the energies of miraculous possibilities.

And,

Any time you have a painful thought/memory/flashback/worry/belief:

1. Find the belief...

2. Write 11 DISADVANTAGES 
to having the belief 

3. Write 11 ADVANTAGES 
to having the belief

If you can NOT find advantages 
then that’s EXACTLY 
why you're stuck!!

When you finally see both sides... 

Your mind will STOP thinking about it 
'cause your brain will be rewired. 

So you gotta keep at it,
until you find the positive
to the negative...
And therefore, ultimately 
rewire your brain!

AND REMEMBER:

STOP making it all about manifestation 
when really, it's actually all about VIBRATION!

AND:

If you haven't heard today...

You are so very loved 
and you are so very worthy 
of love. 

The hardest part 
is learning to love yourself 
and to know: it's not all your fault, 
and to see: that you're beautiful;
wonderfully perfectly 
brilliantly created. 

You're stronger than most;
a true leader/warrior in the making. 

Keep going 
and keep thanking. 

Remember Jesus was an outcast 
and he suffered more 
than any human being 
could ever endure...

And the most important message here is to forgive them 
and to forgive yourself 
and to love all.

Keep walking in truth.

One of the great poems of the Zen tradition 
ends with this description of the awakened state: 
“To be without suffering over imperfection(s).”

AFFIRMATIVE PRAYER:
I am one with the Divine. 
I experience, peace, BLISS, love, and joy: 
CONSTANTLY AND CONSISTENTLY. 
I experience everything as grace AND AS LOVE. 
I am at peace. I honor the Divine within me.

Our God is able and can see your heart’s cry. 
He knows every tear that has fallen 
and continues to fall from your eyes...

Take heart - Christ is close to the broken hearted! 
He is a God of good surprises.

Throw out the idea of your past, 
throw the past years, completely away. 
Get rid of them, do not acknowledge them any longer. 

Redefine and recreate your self today! HERE! NOW! 
You are an artist and an alchemist and a creator 
and you have the immense power to repaint this dream...

* I am The Song Of the Universe!

Both physical and mental abuse from my birth giver. She made my childhood a living hell. Went to 5 years of therapy to unlearn bad habits, what is child abuse, and how to have a healthier mindset. Just because you're blood-related doesn't mean you owe someone something, especially when my very life was threatened. If you're reading this and you're under 18, there is a way out and it does get better. I spent 5 years away from my birth giver and reclaimed my life and sanity.

You never know what courage lies within you until you're tested. They say God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers.

iTefkqYQz8g,"Trauma itself is so sabotaging especially when experienced at a young age, the brain--designed to also protect us from ""harm"" becomes hijacked which used to seem so strange to me. How can areas within the brain become so disassociated and fractured, characterized by grooming intrusive thoughts, hypervigalism, anger,  and sleep disturbances all within the same organ--only to be vulnerable to more? Going to battle everyday--against my own mind! Makes sense why so many of these memories of traumatic events are repressed. I love this book as it really gives some back story behind where we've come as a mental health community--learning to adequately diagnose and then, treat trauma and it's resulting fallout. Additionally, by tuning in with intention and recognizing the who-what-where-when-&how we start to see what trauma is, how the body holds onto it, whether a combat vet, child, violence/crash survivor. Usually the outcomes share many similarities. PTSD, if it occurs, is usually immediate or of a delayed response. Once set, it's not like you can just talk yourself out of it. Nor have I personally found ONLY talk therapy to be effective on its own. To that end, I believe that having access to multiple-modality, trauma-informed: art therapy, acupuncture/massage, talk therapy (individual & group), EMDR, yoga, etc is paramount to long-term healing. However, with so many addiction clinics across the USA you'd think there'd be as many folks treating or being treated for PTSD, since there is a strong correlation between the two. Although I've not researched EVERY hospital/clinic, I haven't found many centers that effectively address any underlying trauma as heavily as the addiction or catchall diagnosis like ADHD, Bipolar, and Personality Disorders? In the end, being able to define and later comprehend the complex dynamic of trauma that entangles us has provided me-- the missing piece in order to better understand how the body keeps the score, thereby completing this puzzle and allowing me to get the targeted specific treatment for my PTSD.  Take courage and don't give up the fight! Blessings!","Physical & Mental Wellness, Mental Health - Therapy, Mental Health - Addiction, Mental Health - Trauma, Recovery & Self Care"

We can't heal only by rational thought, we have to heal our bodies. They know what we forced our minds to repress. I found myself having very emotional reactions to some of the parts of his book because it hit home for me. Only recently have I begun to realize that my childhood was filled with emotional abuse, and at times I feared for my physical safety. I fell into the pattern of many others thinking, ""Well others have it worse. I have food, water, and a roof over my head, I should be happy."" When in reality, I was a victim of narcisstic abuse, I was a victim of an emotionally volatile parent, I was a victim in a lot of ways. Taking back my power, breaking the cycles which raised me, and finding the compassion for myself I was never taught to have is a huge part of the healing journey. I also recognize now that healing is continuous, and as one piece seems to come together, another may come up and ask for attention. I realize now that there's a difference between parents making mistakes and full-blown abuse. This topic truly is of utmost importance in my eyes. We don't talk about it enough, we don't have enough resources for it, and we shut people down instead of building them up out of the darkest parts of their worlds.

I will not state my current age for obvious reasons, but I am a minor. The things I'm about to say are things that I still deal with (well, most of it). So, I'll start in chronological order.
When I was only a year old, my mother left my father and I due to drugs. She never made it to the court dates for custody, so I was left with my father. I never seemed upset in the first bit of my life, though. I lived happily, laughing at small things. I remember getting overwhelmed from things like fireworks or even the wind, which my father began blaming in my mother screaming in my face when I was an infant. But I think it's something much more.
I had been told that when I was left alone at home. My father worked nightshift, so when he came home sometimes he would just pass out and forget to call a babysitter. So there I was, 1 - 3 years old, alone. I'm not sure if anything further happened at that age, but my grandmother has said that she remembers me being potty-trained and my father would yell at me and go on and on, even though I didn't even understand what he was saying.
when I was four years old, we moved into an apartment complex. This is where trauma really started. Or maybe it's because I can remember it. I remember being pushed down, kicked, pinned down. I remember one particular time when I was hungry, so I went to the kitchen but I was too small to reach anything. I came back to my father, and he knocked me down and told me to stay still. 
I also remember if I did something that pretty much every kid my age did, like not cleaning my room, my father would yell and punch the walls and sometimes even punch a hole in the wall. It made me terrified of him. I do remember one time when I was supposed to read to my father. It was an advanced book for my age, but my father wouldn't help me. Instead, he threatened me until I could read.

First break because I wrote a lot and it's pretty spooky. This is pretty much my entire life story.

As well, I remember my first kindergarten class. I was always neglected by the teacher. She smoked in class, she would force us to constantly do jigsaw puzzles (to this day I am still shaken every time someone asks me if I want to do a jigsaw puzzle), when we would actually do something and I would get maybe two questions wrong I would be forced into time out, etc. I was eventually relocated to a different school about halfway through the year.
Then, at seven, we moved again. I don't remember much happening at this point, but I remember I had a phone. I would be in my room constantly, getting on to Roblox when I wasn't supposed to (my father thought it was a chatting site). I remember my father eventually stopped helping me with food, so I began getting my own food each day. He even got sick for eleven days, and I felt obligated to help. I do know that around this time I stopped asking for help, even when my father said it was okay to. This was also around the time when my father would ""help with math homework"", which would be him yelling at me until I wrote an answer down.
I then moved again at age nine. This was a nice trailer tucked in the woods, which kept a lot of privacy. This was when I first started getting online. I remember it was the app Amino at first. My father found this one day and started yelling at me, and he punched the cupboard...and broke his hand. He stopped punching things after that. But, after he broke his hand and if people asked what happened, he would always blame the incident on me. It felt...horrible.
I then moved yet again at eleven. I am still, to this day, in that house I moved to. This was also the time when I found the app Discord, which I still use today. This is also when I went into middle school. I remember my first year of middle school, towards the end, I started getting bullied a bunch. People would mock me, bark at me, throw pencils at me, shove me, etc. They shut up quickly when I punched one of them.
Then, in seventh grade, I started getting into relationships. I remember one relationship was horrible. They would cut themselves, so I brought them to the bathroom to clean them up. They did it again the next day, so I cleaned them. One day, after all my struggles, they claimed to have overdosed and showed me the pill bottle...this broke me. So, what do you think I did? I overdosed. It wasn't much, but I picked one of the worst to overdose on...Tylenol. I told a friend, who then called the police. Nothing really happened other than the police visiting and my father and grandmother figuring out I overdosed.
Yet, the next day, I got sick and I was sent to the hospital. I didn't eat for four days, until I was sent to the mental hospital. And I remember the first day, they drew my blood twice. The second time was a bunch of bottles, I think they did too much because I glanced over and there were, like, nine bottles of blood. After he finished, I felt light headed. He moved me to a different chair, and I ended up vomiting a bunch. I was sick the rest of the day.
I then left the mental hospital after nine days.

You think that's it? Hah. There's more. Go get some water and use a toilet break before you continue hearing my life story....

I left public school and went into homeschooling. This forced me to have online relationships only. I remember this one guy who I ended up dating...he was...horrible. We dated for a few days before one day he said he overdosed. The next day, his brother and mother texted me through his account saying he went to the hospital and died. I was horrified. For a bit. Until the next day he came in, said he was alive, broke up with me, blocked me, and then went on to date someone else. He lied to me, and I've realized now that he never overdosed.
I have also been forced into multiple online situations where I have been groomed.
Now is close to the end. Or rather, close to where I am now in life. For this, we do need to backtrack a bit...
This was a couple months after I left the mental hospital. I remember I was in the car with my father. He then saw the best thing for a deeply political man to see - an abortion sign. He began saying how abortion was wrong and all that. He even said, ""if a girl is raped and has a baby, she shouldn't kill it. She should keep it as a reminder. The girls are always the ones who provoke the men into raping her. I'm glad you are modest because..."" he hesitated here...he knew it was wrong. ""...you have a really nice body.""
THAT. SHOULD NEVER BE SAID TO A 13 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.
I remember as well, he had me take of my shirt so he could ""see how skinny I was"". He proceeded to touch just under my breast, all of my torso, etc. making the claim he was just looking at how skinny I was. I also remember that he has touched my buttocks (luckily with my pants on), said that I can walk around just in my bra, and he threatened to put a camera in my room. He's said other rather sexual comments, etc.
I called CPS one time. This was actually very recently, in the last couple weeks. I was forced to stay away from my father for a bit, luckily. I went to the children advocacy center and got questioned, and then after that...they let me go back to my father...and they didn't do anything. Instead, they actually told him what I told them. Nothing has really come out of it yet, but I can tell he backed off from sexualizing me. He still manipulates me, though...

Now, we are where I am today. Looking into trauma, trying to figure out what's wrong with me, and wishing I could go back. I am currently left to the point where I see myself as a sex object, forced to please others. I am constantly drawn to find someone to use me due to something called trauma looping. I view myself as weak, and sometimes I wonder if my story is a lie. But if it was, then I have no idea what my life would have truly been like. The only thing that I can tell myself that makes me feel a bit better is this: ""Strength doesn't lie in the ability to defend yourself - it lies in surviving through the times you can't defend yourself.""

Thank you for making it to the end of this. I'm sorry that it's so much...I'm just dealing with a shitton that I can't get out of.","Social & Emotional Wellbeing, Mental Health - Trauma"

And when a person goes to find a public toilet they lose their sleeping spot.

I know people who just urinate in their pants in the middle of the night so they don't lose their sleeping spot and for safety of not using a public toilet late at night.

How about we problem solve this?

Surely we can pay for Security throughout the night in this Church Courtyard so people can sleep safely and use the bathroom.

That is the part of our brain that is thoroughly wired. It works right from the beginning and trauma impacts it right from the beginning. Everything you're detailing here is saying it as it is. People get rejected. They're not normalized. There's something wrong with them. They give them drugs to and ""fix them"" and people remain plagued by their anxiety, plagued by their trauma. Bottom line it is their original brain, and which runs their body, which is ran by the sympathetic nervous system.

The original brain is experiencing the world and it still thinks? they're about halfway up the food chain and danger exists all around. This is no judgment to any human. I am human. I have been traumatized. I can react, but this is what I have figured out about this whole process . It's extremely difficult to be a human, extremely difficult because we have this original brain running us in this modern life which is a very busy busy busy life. Our original brain can't keep up.

Bessel van der Kolk belongs to the ISSTD, an organization that believes menstruations is symbolic of being apart of satanic cults, that memories can be repressed and later recovered, and that a single brain can house multiple personalities. They deal in absolutism in the form of their Theory of Structural Dissociation, denying all other well understood conceptualizations, including the one present in the DSM for Dissociative Disorders; they also push for Dissociative Amnesia to be considered a functional disorder rather than a meta-cognition impairment. The ISSTDs role in the Satanic Panic was very hands on, and the organization still shares the sentiment that Multiple Personality Disorder exists. The fact remains, the science present in Kolk's book, ""The Body Keeps The Score"" promotes that memories can be held in somatoform, which is largely disproven and implausible with our current conceptualizations, to acknowledge Structural Dissociation or Somatoform Memories implies that Psychoanalytic theories from the 1890s have to be re-confirmed as true, despite being long debunked.

They only care about it or act like it’s traumatic only if it’s directed towards another group besides white guys. And without more evidence it’s hard to just go based off of what somewhat woke seeming people say. Wokeness I know is extremely evil corrupt thing so anyone who hints at that makes me feel like they’re misdirecting. I know the woke will say that’s wrong as they want to the downplay the evils of wokeness but for me any hint of wokness  is a massive red flag in terms of their credibility and basic sanity. 

And some of the practitioners of these concepts seem to use it to excuse the negative actions of monitories or women as they make up some inaccurate idea of them being in a victim group as if others are less in that group.

My primary doctor found it 2 months ago. 35 years of scars, angry muscles, and skin that grew wrong all has to get massaged out, along with a universe of feelings. I couldn't figure out what was going on in my own body until I moved to a more emotionally stable, supportive environment. Feelings get massaged out of some odd places, like a couple weeks ago there was a pocket of really intense gratitude for cafeteria/lunchroom workers in my bicep. 

If something hurts, feels off, whatever, and you can't make it go away with massage/ice/heat/positive talk/dragon's butt powder, get thee to a health professional to help you.

iTefkqYQz8g,"Probably not a healthy way to go about it but this was a method I used to bring me back into the present from trauma.

I put everyone and everything I associated with trauma into their own boxes and I put those boxes on shelves in my mind. I did that from the past to the present. Now some boxes became very full very quickly, and I either adjusted the size of the box or put something heavy on the lid in my mind. Clearing out these traumas suddenly opened my mind to be nothing but present and I found myself suddenly happier and more focused.

Here comes the tricky part. This is where having someone that you trust completely not only to listen but to also not allow you to wallow in a box. When a current event gets put into a box I had to decide if I wanted to just put it in and deal with it another time or if I wanted to what I called, ""burb the box."" As in talk about how the current thing triggered the trauma in that person's or places box. Talking meant no sugar coating and that means the partner can handle whatever is said and help reason a way through. Not talking meant that at some point it would be talked about when other daily life things gave the time, which does happen.

The biggest down side to this Box Method is that usually a person who has a box will behave in a way so similar to what is in their box that the lid pops off and all the trauma comes out. Again this is when a partner who you trust completely is so very important. They ground you back to the present and after a long talk and tears, putting the lid back on the box is doable.

Like I said maybe not the healthiest way but it took my trauma brain from being hypervigilant and futurecasting to calm and focused.",Mental Health - Trauma

iTefkqYQz8g,"I wasn't in war. I hadn't been beaten. I wasn't tortured. I had just a normal childhood with parents that loved me.

But I still feel traumatisized. I always feel not to be worth same as others. I always feel helpless if someone speaks angrily and loud to me, and in this case I am beginning to get tears. I can't stay strong inside my mind.
I believe others are more loved than me, that they are better, more beautiful, more interesting than me.
I always compare me with others and feel I'm not good enough.
It feels that I have to move beside to let others getting the place I was before.
I always smile and show others how strong I am but inside I am weak and sad.

Long long time I can't understand that.

But now it seems to get closer to the solution.

I was 4 years old. My parents adopted my sister.
Suddenly there was a cute little baby there. And the safe place I had before was gone.
Everybody looked at this baby with soft and beautiful light brown skin (her father was Arabic), dark eyes (I am only white, just boring to look at).

I see and feel how my mother (RIP) was happy with her. And she wanted me also be happy. But I wasn't. I was sad and my heart hurts. But not to hurt my beloved mother I started to smile. To smile while I was crying inside. 

The same pattern I am doing today. 

As a child I wanted to feel beloved too.
I had to step aside to make place for that pretty little girl my mother loved so much. 

My parents are good parents. But none of them can't see all my suffering, all the pain I have to go through. 

I felt be not worth anymore.
I felt that my parents needed another kid because I was not good enough.

Today I know that isn't true but as a kid I felt exactly like this.

My grandmother once told me that somebody gave a chocolat to my little sister and said: what a lovely little girl.
And I stood there with nothing. That person not even looked at me.
My grandmother wanted to help me and gave me something else but the pain I felt in this moment I still can feel today in my heart.

I am not worth at all was my feeling in this time.

Today I can see what happened.

A lot of people are suffering from much heavier trauma.

But I struggle with this ""harmless"" situation.

Perhaps I am too sensitive.

But I am sure that there are a lot of people they feel like me.",Mental Health - Trauma

If your energy use is poisoning you, your health (physical and mental) falls in decline. Poor physical or mental health leads to a poorer quality of life. A poor quality of life can lead to the manifestation of internalized or externalized abuse which will inevitably cause micro and macro traumas to the psyche. This can also lead to the traumatized person inflicting micro and macro traumas on others.

iTefkqYQz8g,"During the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 - 2021, I ate this specific type of tiny croissant with chocolate drizzle and powdered sugar. I had 20 in a box for $5. I ate them every morning for breakfast when I started online schooling, and even brought it with me when we stayed in a hotel as a sort of vacation. I struggled a lot in this time, because all my friends were going to school in person, but my parents kept me at home. I had a fight with my best friend right before covid, then all schools were shut down. I never saw my best friend again, because I when I went back to school, I was in different school. These croissants stopped being manufactured sometime in 2021, however my mom found them in another city in 2022 when we were on a vacation. She knew how much I use to like them. When I saw them I was very happy, but when I took the first bite, I was crying heavily. I didn't feel extremely sad, but I felt the tears streaming down my face, and I heard my own voice crack when I tried to tell my family who was watching me that I was okay. Those croissants brought me back to a traumatic time in my life, after avoiding it for so long. My body was shocked from the smell and taste and texture. My family really thought there was something wrong with me. Anyways, since I was only visiting that city because my brother was temporarily stationed there, I have never seen or eaten that exact croissant. I still love eating regular chocolate croissants with powdered sugar, but I've never seen those specific ones again.

i thought it was normal, since i already had previous confrontations (not equally as bad as this one) and that i wouldn’t be THAT affected, until i bumped into his table at school and he swore (more like yelled out a curse). that moment made me relive that event that occurred a year prior, i was terrified and felt like i was dying. i told my psychiatrist and psychologist and after long conversations they diagnosed me with PTSD

iTefkqYQz8g,"We don’t live in a “simulation”, 
or at least not in the sense that it’s like a computer game. 

Although the computer game metaphor does provide a useful tool 
to understanding the nature of reality. 

People generally don’t understand the interplay 
between the phenomenological world and consciousness. 
They are not separate from each other, they are one and the same, two sides of the same coin. 
You have to understand that the phenomenological physical world 
wouldn’t exist without consciousness. 

Without a conscious perceiver, physical reality, the universe, is just information. 
It is the existence of consciousness that decodes that information into a perceivable reality. 

Much like a computer game is nothing but information on a disc, 
which is then decoded by the computer and presented as a world 
on a screen to be experienced. 

Another aspect to this is the issue of free will. 

We say we have free will, but you can’t transform yourself into a dragon 
and fly to Jupiter to eat pancakes with Darth Vader. 

So we only really have free will within certain parameters. 
Like the parameters of a computer game. 

Consider that when you play a big open world computer game, 
all of the millions of different choices you can make are all encoded on the disc 
and exist all at once. 
It seems like you have free will, 
but every decision you make is already programmed within the parameters of the game. 
I think reality is much like this. 

The sum total of all existence and all reality, 
everything that has existed, does exist and ever will exist, exists at all times infinitely. 

I think the world we perceive, 
at the conscious level we perceive it, 
is a projection down to our third dimensional reality 
from higher dimensions, 
which begins at a realm of infinite information and possibility, 
which then projects down through multiple dimensions 
and becomes more refined and solid 
until you start getting perceivable worlds like ours. 

For an easy way to imagine this, 
you can take a three dimensional cube 
and use it to project a shadow of a two dimensional square. 
If you change the orientation of the cube, the shadow can also look like a hexagon. 
Nothing has changed at the three dimensional level, just the orientation. 
This is three dimensions projecting down into two dimensions, 
but now consider it going up the other way...
Try and think of what a four dimensional or five dimensional cube would look like. 
You can’t, because we live in a three dimensional world. 
Just like how a being that lived in a two dimensional world 
wouldn’t be able to imagine what a sphere looks like. 

It’s not a “simulation”, it’s just the nature of the reality we live in. 
This is just what it does. 
Nothing was ever created, 
nothing is ever truly destroyed. 
Everything is an endlessly churning, recycling sea of energy and information, 
that produces consciousness at various levels 
in order to experience itself objectively.

iTefkqYQz8g,"It all caught up to me. I have had seven children . Some of the births were unambiguously traumatic.

I was pushing myself through day after day of life, running on the hope that all of my good work would someday pay off. Someday my happily ever after would begin. 

My body began to quit when my hope ran out. When I started to question my hope, and realized things were never going to get better. 

In my twenties and thirties I kept hoping that someday, my husband would begin to care about parenting and I wouldn’t be doing it alone. I also hoped that someday we would have a connection. 

Around 40 years old, I let him know how entirely neglected and unloved I felt. I told him about how much it hurt to feel like I was dying pregnancy after pregnancy, birth after birth, without him even caring. 

Through all those years, with birth related injuries, and symptoms of strokes, very severe debilitating neck pain, and chronic migraines and joint pain, raising the children was always still 100% my job, not his. 

And when I told him how much that hurt, he laughed at me and yelled at me. 

That’s when my body really began to quit. Since that time, the migraines and joint pains have gotten worse. Whenever I get sick with a cold or flu, it seems to last for months, and never really gets better. I have had seasons without the use of my left arm, because my hand wouldn’t work. 

I’ve sought answers from my Dr. and done a couple tests, like an ultrasound to try and find why my lower right rib hurts so much, and a neurological exam on my left arm, to see what was wrong with it. But no answers. My Dr. thinks I need a very expensive M.R.I. which even after insurance, we can’t afford. 

But I know my body is quitting because I have lost hope. 

I’ve considered allowing myself to hope that maybe my children will still love me when they’re adults, to give myself something new to hope for. But that’s another bad gamble. 

I do hope to be rescued from hell, and have peace in heaven with Jesus after this life is over. I believe I’ll have joy in heaven. But it doesn’t mend the broken heart I have to live with here and now.

Through the years, I read some books on marriage, and tried to get my husband to read them, or at least listen to me read them aloud, but he just snores.

iTefkqYQz8g,"My husband's family is the closest to normal I have ever seen. He and I both lost our fathers when we were 8, so that was a traumatic event but, not caused by a negative family system for either of us. I became his Mom's caregiver in her last years and I have to say they were pretty stark, raving normal. Of course I wasn't there when he was growing up, but the stories he tells are good stories of loving, family time and lots of road trips to interesting places doing fun things. He said he never heard his parents say a harsh word to each other. (I am not of the school of though that it's ""healthy"" to argue and fight and if you don't, you are suppressing something) They were just very compatible, but also a lot older than his peers' parents, so there was maturity there. It was another era, so our country was culturally and socially different as well.  I worked in direct care psych for years so I do have some perspective and have studied different family systems on my own. Judging from some of the case histories of my patients, I am not surprised that they store so much trauma in their bodies. One thing I noticed in particular with addicts is that they are very past focused and relay traumatic experiences over and over...it's ""stuck"" in their energetic system. They keep going back to it, and are unable to heal and move on.  I like the idea of working with an experienced practitioner in Bach Flower Essences, they have yielded some remarkable results and are non-toxic. If they don't help, they can't hurt. That and Trauma Informed Therapy, for sure. We were introduced to it but if we wanted to do a deep dive, we had to seek out our own training and education. I may go back to working in psych again, and I have been meaning to get this book and read it anyway...this is just the push I need. Thank you for the video, Dr. van der Kolk. I am also interested in German New Medicine (why don't we hear about that anymore?) and how emotional trauma manifests as physical disease which is part of what we are talking about here. I hope that someday Dr.Daniel Amen's SPECT scan will become standard of care for psych patients as well. His first book about it came out 25! years ago and still hardly any of the psychiatrists, psych RNs, NPs or PAs have heard about it. If it's true that it takes 50 years for things to change in medicine, we can't afford to wait another 25. Addiction and mental illness is increasing rapidly in our population. People need real help NOW, and I agree that drugs and CBT don't work very well, especially in the long term.

His idea that physical manifestations of trauma can proceed memory recall is also controversial and almost led to his entire life`s work being discredited ,got him removed from the Harvard Psychiatry Board, when it became public. Also this definition of trauma, specifically of recalled memory, has led to a social contagion of self-diagnosing individuals who were shown to sometimes literally make-up these memories mistaking certain somatic symptoms as trauma manifestations. Also important to note is Kolk`s. therapeutic approaches, there are no randomized control trials proving evidence that his ""body therapy"" can work on fixing trauma.

I get a lot of anxiety whenever homosexuality is discussed, say among colleagues or even online, because I have heard it being misrepresented and demonized since my childhood so I think the same is going to happen again.

I've grown up in a Muslim country and the standard teaching of Islam is that if two men have sex, they must be killed and I have seen many (what Westerners would call ""moderate Muslim"") people who agree with this religious teaching (please no whitewashing replies about how Islam is somehow gay-friendly; it's really not and is actually a harmful ideology). Love between two men is demonized and mocked. Support for gay people is admonished because it's ""un-Islamic."" I haven't come out nor has anyone else in my country. One guy came out in a foreign country and the reaction here was negative and dehumanizing.

The anxiety I feel is so significant that I will most probably not read the replies that I may get to this comment because I fear they will be vitriolic and hurtful. I guess that is my trauma.

iTefkqYQz8g,I went through a  lot of traumatic experiences the first one was when I was in kindergarten and a bunch of male students threw me on a table pinned me down and tried to pull my panties off of me . I still remember how terrified I felt. I had one friend that tried to help me . When the substitute teacher came back in the room I was crying and she told me to get off the table. She showed me no compassion. I was raised in a loving family but going through that made me feel unsafe.  When I became an adult I got involved with some weird stuff and I ended up in a situation where I feared that my entire family was going to be killed and I was CONSTANTLY terrified. Couldn’t sleep at night or function . I developed PTSD but like a lot of us I didn’t know ANYTHING about mental illness also I was raised very religious so I felt that if I told someone about my problems they would just say that I was possessed and they would avoid me or aggressively pray over me.  I didn’t want to worry anyone so I just suffered alone. I read scriptures and stuff to help me. They gave me hope and kept me from un@living myself but I couldn’t function very well in life. I never dated anyone . I couldn’t work much or focus on goals I just wanted to feel safe. I also kept dealing with triggers and that made me isolate myself. Anyways nowadays I’m  doing a little  better I was never able to get professional help but now I can fall asleep at night without being scared. I’m not triggered very often anymore either. I’m behind in life though and that has caused me to dislike myself.,"Mental Health - Fear, Physical & Mental Wellness, Mental Health - Trauma"

iTefkqYQz8g,"I always have to remind myself that PTSD is PTSD, because I put myself down with telling myself that it's not true PTSD because people have gone through way worse.
But it is, I need to remind myself always that it is still PTSD.

Back when I was living with my parents, in our middle of nowhere off-grid living. It was a wood building constructed around a quonset hut metal shell.
I was home alone when I fire broke out. 
The best guess from the firemen after the fact was that the wires from the generator sparked and where the wires were sparking there was some junk around the outside. It caught and spread against the side of that hut until finding a way through and once it reached the wooden interior it was.. fast.

I didn't know of the fire until it was too late to stop it from the outside, because the smell of wood burning I thought was from the woodstove I had started because it was chilly.


I was in such a panic and we lost.. basically everything. But what still haunts me, is loosing all the dogs. I had been so wrapped up in trying to save some kittens before the smoke and quickly the fire spread too much to go in there.

It wasn't until it was too late that I realized my dogs were still in there except for one Vanilla who was out there with me.. but she got so scared by me screaming out the other dogs names that she fled into that house and.. and I remember hearing a whimper from her in there and then never coming back out. Her corpse was just barely inside, near what used to be the couch of the Living Room.
We lost four dogs that day, and I blame myself for it so much.

And now, what triggers my PTSD is fire sparking up. Either by burning something that burns fast, fuel or paper, or like for example because I work in a Kitchen someone cooking shrimp scampi without warning me since you cook that with the fire flaring way up.
I am also really stressed out by the smell of mesquite wood burning. It sets me in high alert, and used to set me into a panic but I've worked through that at least.",Mental Health - Stress

Also, it's NOT necessary.  We as humans have already conquered our world mostly.  We don't have to worry about much, except natural disasters and disease, etc.  HOWEVER, we are our own worst enemy on ALL other issues.  It's self-inflicted.  It's also NOT ok.  I believe that if we don't overcome this, humanity will go extinct.  Yeah, I think it's THAT big.  Also, if we overcome this self-inflicted Capitalism disease, we can arrive at a level of peace never seen before.  But, we're all carrying all these past violence issues.

As someone who was abused since childhood in the extreme sense of abuse, it angers me how many 'medics' try and call it a mental health disease, its not, it takes patience and kindness and safe space, and being incapacitated by medics is a very traumatising experience as hospitals are terrifying places for a lot of people. I have also been medically abused to shut me up so I would  not indulge information, I don't really like doctors much today or nurses. Sorry but that is my experience, they made this raped child 'sicker' and it did not stop the abuse in that envirionment, because abusers are also in those settings, and being pharmaceutically poisoned, makes one vulnerable for that too while also destroying and dulling the mind, energy and ability to reason with oneself.

iTefkqYQz8g,"I found this interesting because of my work as a massage therapist and instructor. Having worked on people facing death with terminal illness, to those without limbs due to traumatic shooting, to car accidents, to those simply wanting to excel in sports, and the list over 28 years goes on. Simple stress is often what many think of when the think massage. There is a difference. I find it interesting that the muscles hold memories and reveal trauma. Some muscle memory not the kind such as repeating training as in sports activities but past injuries, scare tissuse that people connect memory to is found. In a relaxed daze of relaxation suddenly begin speaking of past trauma. My work is  mindful of and identifies what parts of the nervous system are active. Along with the neurology and parts of the body holding onto something, and/or reacting either voluntarily or involuntarily. I tried making each session the most beneficial to the person as a high priority. I've spent much time focused on and studying sessions. In my work phantom pain, has been of much interest. The trauma effecting the person and effects on that, has lead to many interesting observations of the mind body connections. Such as a person's sudden uncontrolled spasmodic trembling in part of a remaining limb that was shot. Duly noted was once on the side of the table with only a thigh remaining. The remaining limb began trembling uncontrollably. Observing heart rate rise with no effort on the part of the person. It was easy to check if the parasympatic nervous system was active. The person somewhat paniced said, ""Sorry dont know why its just shaking. Im not doing that."" Deciding to take a seated position it instantly stopped. It was described that  someone stood over them when they were shot and lost part of their limb. As well as many revesion surgeries throughout the healing process for prosetic. Assumeably doctors, nurses changing band ages, etc stood doing so. Upon taking a seated postion and not posture immitating the same experiences was interesting. Immediately the person looked up at me and said, ""What happened? How did you make the spasms stop."" The phantom pain described as their leg twisting and going down into hot cement that burns. It once was people would be described as hysterical, held down, drugged, a prosthetic forced on, sometimes one of both. Looked upon as someone with mental condition from trauma only and no pyschical explanation. It is now widely known that the brain activity and signals to the brain from the removed limbs is often still active; though no limb is there. Through much work and observation of my own, I enjoy the discussion on body, mind connections as well as being mindful of trauma the body and mind hold from traumatic experiences. I find they are as common as the memories muscles hold. One learns to ride a bike and the body remembers how to. It does not need relearned unless a neurological incident dictates. Such as in a sever head injury. The re-education of the muscles and its effects on the mental wellbeing as well as overall health is something I've observed. It is fasinating to me the mind body connections. As well as the whole person healing. Observing with feedback from others of, personality changes in people with foot placement problems that recieve work, that improves such,  is one of many of the mind body connection examples that is fascinating. I could listen and talk for hours on the subject. Bridging that gaps is wonderful for people.","Mental Health - Stress, Recovery & Self Care, Work & Study Life, Mental Health - Trauma"

The body understands that life itself is traumatic and will cover traumatic memories with amnesia in many instances. Take birth for example. Mothers forget the feeling of the pain of labor, only remembering the fact that it included some large amount of pain. And newborn babies are suddenly pulled from the warm, cozy space they’re used to in the womb into this cold, bright, unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people poking you and wiping the gunk off you and you have no idea what the heck is happening. There is no such thing as a “perfect parent,” because even if one did exist, the children would still have trauma just based off the fact that trauma happens in the perception of events, not in the events themselves.

iTefkqYQz8g,"Trauma being sort of a 'normal' thing for everyone is such an eye-opener (""No such thing as a normal family."") It means it was under our noses and we never cared to give it proper attention. It means that something we originally thought was just for a specific group of Other/outcast people, is now something at the very front of society that affects all ages and groups of people. I see people start to be open about their experiences over the past few years or so. Mental health is something we all need to be aware of, and something we as a society unfortunately cast aside and are reaping the damning consequences of it. How can we now move forward in mental health as a societal problem?

Not really into religion, but I noticed that Christianity (the nicer aspects of it at least), and eastern religions often talk about suffering as part of the inherent human experience. That's not a common conversation modern society currently has. It might be important to learn from those practices in some way. This can even be extended to art, as art is probably the only place that suffering still has a say in, and coincidentally something modern society has abandoned for hard sciences and efficient money-making.",Mental Health - Trauma

But I let it be and they have acted so normal, they have voiced so many things themselves about what they want to do and how they want to do it and feel. And it’s not always honest cuz they mess up or lose focus and drive, but it comes back and they don’t let the drugs and mental state get to them as much in the same ways all the time. They still do, but I just have it make sure I’m safe and they’re not hurting anyone and I don’t have to stop it. They do less bad things and less crazy things around me even if they are high sometimes and scary, they still voice that they are going through it on their own and not hurting others. They have been crazy and high for years amongst people, arrested or violent outburst but never hurt anyone or touched them without respect of their own situation. If that’s true like it seems from what I’ve seen, and I don’t assume it is true, but he is consciously trying to not hurt others cuz when he does the world or them or the evil things he sees constantly and can’t hide from but just let’s it be and doesn’t affect him then he chooses to not mess with it and only when he is in a bad place and high is when he might or has hurt others, I’m thinking could be the situation. And since no one is there for him then he doesn’t have the chance to work on it any more than he has naturally to cope with how to survive in his own world and ours, while dealing with who he is from his past and his actions now of drug use. He was military and did so many drugs he’s now just in this stereotypical situation and it’s risky for me or others to even talk with him but he’s spent many nights with me crying, laughing, and thinking.

Psychiatrist and neuroscientist Bessel van der Kolk, author of ""The Body Keeps the Score,"" has been studying trauma for 50 years and treating various traumatized populations. Trauma can occur in many different forms, from sexual molestation to physical abuse to witnessing violence. The lingering effects of trauma can make individuals hyperreactive to mild stressors and lead to difficulty feeling safe in their bodies. The challenge of treating trauma is helping individuals feel safe in their bodies and live without fear. The mainstream system of psychiatry and psychology often approaches mental health as something that needs to be fixed, rather than understanding the impact of trauma on a person's life. It's vital to recognize that trauma is a common experience and to approach treatment with empathy, understanding, and a focus on creating a safe environment for individuals to heal.","Mental Health - Stress, Work & Study Life, Mental Health - Fear, Mental Health - Trauma"

My major stress point  - where I trip over - is dealing with call centres, especially if the person I'm interacting with has an accent of some kind. Because I know this - I get in first, explain and apologise.

But it happens all the time. I've had to literally fight to ensure I get ongoing treatment for macular degeneration on schedule - that's traumatising & I shouldn't have to do it. Another time it took TEN DAYS for a company I was dealing with to inform me of a policy that was - for me, at the time - an absolute deal breaker. Then there was another service provider that allowed me to lodge an application for service when I did NOT meet their client criteria  - I found that out TWO WEEKS later - AND it wasn't a case of them not knowing from the get go I didn't meet their criteria, because I was open & honest about my situation. Or another service provider to whom I had to repeat a traumatic story TWICE to find our I didn't fit their remit either - and whether or not I did fit their remit was the FIRST QUESTION I ASKED coming off being on hold. I'm STILL dealing with supply line issues as regards a prescription medication used to help control diabetes - a supply line issues that's been ongoing since mid 2022 (I'm writing this in Nov 2023), advice is that there will be supply line issues extending into 2024.

Unless a person has employer sponsored healthcare we don’t get access to anything but nurse practitioners in this state. This his the only state I’ve ever lived in like this, and it’s destroying my life. 

Even paying for insurance I was forced to wait six full months before anyone would so much as refill a prescriptions and in that time I post my job. The cascade of problems stemming from that is debilitating. 

My symptoms have never been worse. Does anyone know how I can access immediate help with dissociative identity disorder and complex PTSD with Medicaid? In the state of Washington? 

Does anyone know how to help me hold someone accountable for this? My life has been stolen from me by holding my healthcare hostage and I am the only one facing a consequence for something totally outside of my control!

iTefkqYQz8g,"I'm a licensed therapist, working with clients who have cPTSD, for the last 16 years. Almost 10 years ago, at the time that Bessel published The Body Keeps The Score, I went to a 2 day conference of his. I had no idea who he was (at the time I was not the best at keeping up with current research). Learning of his work changed my life. I then spent a week with him at his Esalen retreat. It is incredible, how much I learned from him. He guided me towards trainings and treatments that transformed my practice and how I conceptualize my clients' treatment. I am so thankful to have spent time and learned from this man. His perspective and his work is extremely important for our species. At the time, many countries were changing their mental health practice because of his input. America was of the few places that refused to apply his research. He developed this diagnosis for the DSM-V that would revolutionize the way we treat clients/patients. Because his work would wipe out a lot of diagnoses, and therefore, wipe out the need for a great deal of pharmaceuticals, which would then, affect the money coming into insurance and drug companies, the US refused to acknowledge his very valid and important research. Hopefully that is changing but who knows. It does seem that people in my field are starting to have a deeper understanding of EMDR, trauma in a person and the significance of very early neglect in a person life. His ""Attachment Trauma"" diagnosis gave me a foundation to help clients who had never been able to find help regarding their root symptoms. I now have client who have processed infancy traumas and have a significant reduction in suffering. Many of my clients have been to countless therapists and found no relief. I have clients who are so paralyzed by their early childhood trauma, they don't even realize what is happening in their bodies. Witnessing the freedom that comes with this work is profoundly rewarding. I write this because I want everyone human out there to know that there is freedom from the pain created by trauma.

DmtCSs0KWGE,"Personally, social media is more good than bad. However, I think this is largely due to how I prefer to use it. I predominantly watch long form content, like 30+ minutes, so I haven't noticed a shortening attention span. I also usually don't watch smthg when I'm taking transportation, maybe I'll put on a podcast. I'll take time each day to pause and just sit in silence to make sure my brain has thinking time. I do have my days where I just watch youtube video after video, but even if I engage with nothing those days I still don't get out of bed and I end up sleeping through the day. If I put on a HealthyGamerGG video when I'm in that mood it can take me out of that funk and I'll actually do smthg. Social media also lets me keep in contact with friends when university keeps me too busy. I also use it to keep on top of current events, particularly politics. If a form of content is making me feel worse I block it or at least don't engage. When I'm dreading doing an assignment I sometimes treat a Youtube video as a reward, x amount of work and I get to watch one 10-20 minute video. So far all this has worked out for me, but  other people will have other strategies. If you can't form a positive relationship with social media then yeah, I highly recommend limiting your exposure to it. When it comes to kids, they need to be taught healthy use strategies. I got onto social media as a kid just in time for that 2010-2015 boom, and while things turned out fine for me there were a lotta spaces online I definitely shouldn't have been in.

DmtCSs0KWGE,"I think that putting the cell phone in the hands of a teenager interferes with our interactions with the people around us. We have less experiences just being bored and connecting with people. People become flattened into what their internet selves represent them to be.

Kids who have secure attachments and healthy home lives are not going to fall prey as often to those who need to mentally escape their home, who are already vulnerable to mental illness. 

I think if we could do some large population studies with good data and hypothesis structuring, there would be ample evidence for the link between to two. 

We also need to be regulating technology development because infinite scroll and notifs are predatory to our motivational/ reward system. The data is there for that.

There's also plenty of evidence that shows creativity is born out of boredom, and that's not something we're allowing to happen for kids.

Yes a lot of things were fundamentally different. It sounds nice, but unfortunately you really can't go back to how things were 20-25 years ago.

On the whole we as a society have gone too far with mindlessly chasing pleasure, comfort and convenience. We have given up too much autonomy and independence to lies about safety, security and comfort. Half the things we have to deal with aren't even comfortable or convenient to use, they are convenient to the large corporations and political elites who rule us, or at best we are talking about short-term conveniences. Communities and communal spaces have been disappearing steadily for 40-50 years and it shows in our economics and politics, culture and attitudes. All sorts of change or advancement is a compromise of some sort and we have never asked ourselves what we are giving up and in exchange for what. Sometimes you do need to give up a bit of comrot and convenience for the sake of long-term wellbeing, overall health and competence.

We're on the screen/in the phone all day, and go to bed with a load of undigested information in our memory store and when in life it comes to the decisions we need to make, we don't have our own thoughts based on our digested stock of memory, but start using our non-digested vast, unreviewed and non-proven - to say yes and no to things, happenings, and people. It literally means we start saying yes or no to something because the latest most dopamine-sugar-coated thing on the net did so, and we didn't even take the time to digest their stuff to the point where we said we agree or don't agree.

DmtCSs0KWGE,"I disagree that social media only amplifies other problems. But even if that were true, does this question really matter? At the end of the day social media is making our lives worse and regulating the use of social media is a decision that could significantly improve wellbeing and is easier to do than solving the myriad of interconnected and deeply rooted societal problems. And it doesn't have to be one or the other; the regulation of social media is not going to stop the efforts to tackle societal problems, but could provide imo a significant mental health relief. 

I do agree however that now that the social media genie is out of the bottle, effectively regulating it will be difficult (but not impossible). This draws attention to the imo more fundamental underlying problem that technologies are developed and diffused without actually considering the impact on our wellbeing. No society can actually stop and say: do we want this technology? do the positives outweigh the negatives? What are the risks? etc. When it comes to decisions on technology, there is no real social realm, there are only the individual consumer decisions taken by individuals who are pressured by society and advertisements which exploit our human instincts to sell these technologies. Given that the hegemonic ideology in the world is technicism (the unquestioned faith in technology) suggesting restrictions on technological development is taboo in our society as it threatens the myth of progress and has the potential to lead to domination by more technologically advanced societies. This is the logic of civilisation which has caused and will cause so much suffering in the world. Addictive technologies which are harmful to us are by definition likely to diffuse throughout society because of their addictive nature. What will the next technology be that will cause widespread suffering? Why aren't we more skeptical about unchecked technological development?

Finally I also take issue with your characterisation of the social media debate as a left-right issue. The divide rather is primarily generational and secondarily between liberals (in the sense of traditional liberalism) and non-liberals. There are plenty of issues on which the left favours reducing personal freedoms in return for social gains (smoking, gun control etc).",other

I think it is easy to blame social media when there are so many other societal reasoning for why mental health is declining. I think blaming social media is what lazy people do when they know all that’s left is the young starting a new Arab spring and they want all the young people off so they can’t make a union to change society. Srsly there is climate disasters, government corruption, Microplastics in the blood stream, the health care crisis in the USA, economic turmoil, in the USA a “culture war” where old people who made the culture attack young people who enjoy the culture…

In short, the concern is a technical one - Its about creating an identity system that can lockout specific people from social media and thus public discourse. Whilst the argument of mental health for children is honourable and a nobel cause, it can also be seen as an attempt to crack down on public discourse on the internet. Which such a system the government could also censor activists by labeling them as ""terrorist"" and denying them access to public discourse. Cold fusion made a good video about it: https://youtu.be/yUNDWsR2-Oc?si=xauAucX-AMlaGGat. Additionally, all this comes right after the US Senate passed a bill that forces all companies that run servers in the US to cooperate with the US intelligence agency NSA (https://theintercept.com/2024/12/18/trump-fisa-surveillance-spying/) This is clearly showing how social media institutions have direct institutional ties with governmental represion.",other

This was well before social media, and it was very apparent when I was (at university, basically) thrown into a mix with a load of people from various backgrounds.

It was very apparent to me that the people I met from big city environments had a genuinely different (and to me strange) outlook on social interaction. For better or worse, they saw social interactions in your life far more as something you curated: there's a ton of people out there, find some you get along with, ignore the rest. This obviously makes sense in a big city setting. That was at odds with my experience of social interactions as things that are a given and that you have to learn to negotiate. There's only so many people in the village, and they're not going anywhere, so you're going to have to have _some_ kind of relationship with them, good or bad, so you might as well learn to get along with them as best as possible.

For any townies reading thinking that sounds oppressive or something, that's not to say of course that you can't have favourite people who you enjoy hanging out with, it's more a case of how you approach everyone else. It's about being incentivised to find some kind of positive commonality, or if not then at least tolerating each other, or if not even that then disliking each other. What you can't do as easily is pretend they don't exist!

Whatever else social media does, it seems to me that it does this ""big city"" thing on steroids. The online world is one sprawling 'metropolis' from which you pick and choose, and more importantly _ignore_ the rest. So sure, you can connect with your fellow political travellers (or any other chosen social group), and that is I think genuinely a good thing. But if that process also involves pushing those you _don't_ choose out of mind, to subconsciously start to believe they don't exist, and not to be forced to learn to bump along with random fellow citizens, is that a good thing?

But social media also amplifies bullying, harassment, self-image issues and similar things in an overly toxic manner.

The access to the internet and screens represented an unhealthy quick way to feel good, and this made me addicted to the phone and unable to deal with tough emotions. It created a bad feedback loop. My mental health failures made me more dependent on screens that on their turn, reinforced the avoidance coping mechanism.
I do believe that social media represents an unhealthy coping mechanism that prevents us from facing the real disconfort of healing. If one can not confirm the causality, one can not demy that actively reducing content consumption is key to addressing one s mental state.

These platform economies aren’t aligned with “democracy”, nor do their influence or ownership follow legislative borders. Real borders for citizenship, sovereignty and some democratic influence.

Corporations are indeed transnational, but in turn influence politics and policies - without being present and accountable.

This sounds “liberating” - who wants borders…? Well, large corporations don’t, but (democratic) national institutions can’t cross them (that would be a war, right?). 

Most of us “hate” governments (caveats & simplified), so back in the late 80s we voted these liberties through - no state intervention in business.

You can get a similar effect by compulsively refreshing news sites. However it seems possible that shrinking attention spans, endless scrolling, and the way social media is ever-present (on your phone, by your bed, in the bathroom, on the train, in the classroom etc), are _in themselves_ increasing anxiety by not letting us get a break from the awful, by reducing our time and ability to think things through, and maybe by brain chemistry (dopamine ""addiction"").

 However, I must admit I feel as if we've read two different books. I understand you're talking about social media today but you omitted some pretty important part of Haidts' work: overusing devices with internet connection by children is bad because it takes up the time child could spend on unsupervised face-to-face interaction with other children (or learning while in school).
Additionally, I've got an impression that a person unfamilar with the book would think that Haidt's perceives social media as some kind of sole culprit of raising anxiety in our generation. While he emphasizes that the way parents and schools treat and perceive children as uncapable of self-reliance is the core of the problem. Instead of teaching them how to adult and let them learn social skills they choose to (because of economical and societal factors of course) give them the phone that will entertaine them for hours.

Industrial revolutions change the world, typically because capitalists consume vast debt in order to market overpriced goods to the world. I'm fifty five years old, laptop owner at about thirty years of age, followed by savvy cellphone owner ever since. I will be honest, I have a certain craving for knowledge and information, but after already having been seduced by the very first section of most any library. A gigabyte was unheard of.

The anxiety of not knowing is actually more tension for me. But I complain about the price (for non-repairable $1k iPhones, why even adjust to it, I will never know), and the promises. In the 1990s, Americans were promised public wifi. It was in public, but it was privately operated, and without much f any security that exists today. A sexy RAZR could be WiFi tethered to a laptop with endless data consumption. Now, we pay $5 per gigabyte. For YouTube consumption, for half an hour, that's easily several gigabytes. 

Compare the Internet to the highway. A car, back in the 1930s, has always required exorbitantly increasing maintenance that the owner had to perform themselves, or pay hefty for others to do it. This has been true throughout history, but the cars are everywhere now. Anyone complaining about smoking cigarettes, when the car has probably led to the world's pollution more than anything else.
